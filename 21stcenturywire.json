\u00a9 2020 ) An old road between Balikpapan and Samarinda passes through the poor villages , through rural slums , as well as stalls selling second-rate local fruits .\nThe cheap , unhygienic eateries , are now half-empty .\nWhile the traffic is still heavy here , the \u2018 real action \u2019 is somewhere else ; a few kilometers away , where the new motorway is being constructed ; a motorway which will , eventually , connect Balikpapan , Samarinda and potentially the new Indonesian capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the now dirt poor Sepaku Village , in the area of Penajam Paser Utara .\nThe government of President Joko Widodo ( known as Jokowi ) is promising that the new capital will touch the skies , eclipsing places like Brasilia , Malaysian Putra Jaya , or Canberra .\nNothing short of Dubai or Manhattan , in the middle of the logged out , monstrously scarred , poisoned island of Borneo , known as \u201c Kalimantan \u201d in Indonesia .\nWhile virtually all Indonesian cities could easily be defined as urbanistic disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be totally different , boasting green wide avenues and impressive architectural masterpieces that would be envied by the entire world .\nIndonesia has already made one such an attempt in its recent history \u2013 it promised to convert its island of Batam which is located just a stone \u2019 s throw from Singapore \u2013 into something much more impressive than Singapore itself ( a city-state with one of the highest quality of life on Earth ) .\nTwo years ago , I travelled to Batam , where I discovered a grotesque , bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my previous essays entitled , \u201c Batam Island \u2013 Indonesia \u2019 s Sorry Attempt to Create Second Singapore \u201d .\nThe island had been thoroughly destroyed .\nNothing public was left , and nothing , absolutely nothing was built for the people .\nPrecisely just as in all other parts of Indonesia .\nThe ugliness of the urban areas of Batam was unimaginable .\nCorruption was omnipresent .\nThe feeble attempt to turn the island into an industrial , productive area , collapsed .\nWhat survived , at least for some period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling .\nEventually , the gambling \u2018 industry \u2019 collapsed , too .\nOnly prostitution , together with some sand exports to Singapore , prevailed .\nPresently , there is not one single city in Indonesia , which could be defined as livable .\nNot one .\nWhy would the new capital be any different ?\nWhy would Indonesian people believe the government , which has been known for lying , for building sand castles , and for many long decades of absolute ineptness ?\nThere is not one elegantly built sidewalk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , suddenly be , hundreds of kilometers of beautiful avenues and promenades in the middle of Borneo ?\nAll public places , in all the Indonesian cities , have been commercialized , privatized , or outright stolen .\nWhy would it be different now ?\nWhat is this talk about big parks , green areas ?\nEvery big project in Jakarta , Surabaya or Bandung begins like that : endless promises of \u201c city walks \u201d , of malls overflowing with green areas .\nIn the end : nothing !\nA concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public whatsoever .\nMaritime cities lacking promenades , urban centers without public parks , concert halls , or first-rate museums .\nThere is no place on Earth like this : absolute extreme corruption , and spite for the people .\nSo , is there any reason why the new capital would change the entire culture of graft , or lack of productivity and imagination ?\nIt will be , after all , constructed by the same individuals , same developers , same companies and the same government , as in all other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road on which we drive , most of the people live in poverty , or if international standards were to apply : in misery .\nAt Bukit Suharto ( Suharto Hill ) , a peripheral area of the planned new capital , Ms. Niah , an old woman living alone in her shack , selling traditional rice cakes for a living , is not hopeful about her future .\nHere , as elsewhere in Indonesia , governments have come and gone , dropping empty promises , leaving people with basically nothing , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasrah , which can be loosely translated as \u2018 submissive melancholy \u2019 .\nMs. Niah is not afraid to speak : \u201c I did not know about the plan to move the capital here , by the government .\nThey tell us nothing .\nWhat I know is that I have never felt the benefits of development carried out by the government .\nFor decades , there was no help that I \u2019 d receive .\nI don \u2019 t even get that subsidized rice delivery , which each and every poor Indonesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory .\nI get nothing .\nOn the contrary , I actually feel disadvantaged by what is called development .\nSince the government built the toll road not far from here , the traffic of the vehicles on this road has been reduced , and as a result , my rice cakes do not sell.\n\u201d A few hundred meters away , Mr. Abdul Gani , a retired civil servant actually worries about his future .\nThe government may force him out of his home , if it felt that his land may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new capital project .\n\u201c A few weeks ago , an officer came to the houses in our village to collect information on the ownership deeds for land , buildings and fields , without giving us a hint of what reasons the data collected is for .\nThen , there were rumors circulating in this area , that our land would be taken , confiscated by the government , because we do not have ownership certificates .\nEverything is vague for us .\nWe don \u2019 t know what to expect.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please be serious .\nNo , we don \u2019 t believe that the government could build a city like Dubai here.\n\u201d All along the road , we hardly encounter any native people of Borneo .\nThe entire area is now populated by so called trans-migrants \u2013 individuals and families that were injected here , mainly from Java , South Sulawesi and Bali , after the 1965 military coup orchestrated by the West and by the Indonesian right-wing elites and religious cadres .\nTrans-migrants have been historically placed along the important roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact fascist dictator Suharto considered Dayak native people of this island to be \u2018 Communist \u2019 , because of their traditional , communal culture and way of life .\nHe did not trust them .\nIn fact , he busied himself destroying their \u201c long houses \u201d , and their philosophy of life .\nTrans-migrants have also been playing an extremely important role in Borneo , which is one of the wealthiest , in terms of natural resources , islands on Earth : their increasing presence has guaranteed that the local people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unite and demand independence from the colonialist Java .\nThe entire island is now ruined as a result of Jakarta \u2019 s rule , as well as the \u201c trans-migration \u201d .\nIt has been devastated , burned , deforested , poisoned .\nOnce resembling paradise on earth , it is now scarred and humiliated .\nIts original inhabitants are subjugated , kept divided and badly informed , and uneducated on purpose .\nThen comes the new capital project .\nIn an unusually bold report , the Jakarta Globe wrote on December 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed the names of numerous national and local politicians who would reap profits from the capital city relocation mega-project , including the brother of defense minister Prabowo Subianto , Hashim Djojohadikusumo , and the coordinating minister of maritime affairs and investment , Luhut Binsar Panjaitan .\nThe study , \u201c Who Is the New Capital City For ?\n\u201d was conducted by a coalition of civil organizations ; Mining Advocacy Network ( Jatam ) , the Indonesian Forum for Environment ( Walhi ) , Trend Asia and Forest Watch Indonesia , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oligarchic connections in the mega-project and its environmental and societal impacts .\nThe report revealed names of people who have assets and concessions in the extractive industries such as coal , palm oil and lumber as well as energy plants in the area of East Kalimantan where the new capital is going to be built .\nIt also suggested the project could be used as a smokescreen to brush off the corporations \u2019 dirt for the environmental damage they have done there .\nWithin the 180,000-hectare area for the new so-called smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forestry , palm oil , coal and property concessions .\nAround 158 of them are coal mines that have left at least 94 deadly-deep holes in the area\u2026 \u201d Indonesian girl phone in a typical village in the area \u2013 pollution and misery ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) We met two leading researchers from the Institut Dayakologi ( \u201c Dayakology Institute \u201d ) , Richardus Giring and Julianto Makmur , in the city of Pontianak , West Kalimantan .\nMainly , we wanted to know , whether the relocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm the local people .\n\u201c Since the issue of relocation of the capital was endorsed by the Jokowi government , I have never come across any open and transparent analysis .\nAll the studies tend to show positive aspects , without considering the risks and negative impacts of the relocation ; ignoring the interests of the Kalimantan people .\nThere should be a serious study , analyzing what the relocation of the capital would do to the locals.\n\u201d \u201c Aside from seeing the relocation of the capital as a solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan should also be seen from the perspective of the impacts on Kalimantan and its people .\nWe do not want this capital relocation to be a kind of escape from the problems that Jakarta is facing ; we don \u2019 t want to move those problems to Kalimantan.\n\u201d \u201c The ecological injustice and the destruction of the social structure of the people of Kalimantan have been occurring since a long time ago .\nConsistently , various government sectoral ( forestry , energy , etc . )\nhave only made Kalimantan an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests or other natural resources .\nThe Kalimantan that we see today is a dreadful legacy of the past and present .\nAlthough there are still few areas of pristine tropical forests left on the island , they are only small remnants.\n\u201d Map showing relocation of the new Indonesian capital to the island of Borneo ( Map : Caitlin Dempsey using Natural Earth Quick Start ) Working all over the island , filming and writing about the dreadful situation , for years , we could only agree .\nAnd Mr. Giring continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promising a big , beautiful and magnificent new capital , if it is not preceded by proper and careful planning and study ?\nSo far , what they have done is only feasibility studies based on positive predictions .\nNo studies on the risks , or on the negative impacts that may arise .\nIf it is not done carefully , the whole thing will definitely turn out to be a blunder .\nWe know that this is not just a plan : a lot of resources have already been spent .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anticipate beforehand what lies ahead ; to study risks , the environmental impacts.\n\u201d \u201c If not , people will have no sense of ownership .\nThe new capital will only belong to Jakarta \u2019 s elites , and to Jokowi .\nAnd in the end , it will only move the problems from Jakarta to Kalimantan .\nIt \u2019 s beginning to look like a beauty contest , where the important thing is how things look .\nAs long as they appear to look magnificent , great !\nShort video clips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass media .\nBut it is irrelevant to the people of Borneo and for the entire Indonesia.\n\u201d \u201c I imagine that there will be many potential conflicts that will arise , such as land-grabbing caused by the politics of the state administration .\nThere will also be an exodus of people to the new capital which will certainly trigger conflict with local people.\n\u201d \u201c Well , this is our paradigm of development , which tends to sacrifice the interests of small people for the sake of the elites .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificing the poor/small people .\nIn this case , they are being sacrificed solely for the sake of an \u2018 image or impression , \u2019 as if they were not human beings with dignity.\n\u201d .\nWhile the propaganda that is promoting the new capital is all over the Indonesian mass media , here in Kalimantan there is hardly any information , even about the precise location .\nThe area designated by Jokowi \u2019 s regime is enormous .\nEverything has been hushed up , camouflaged , covered in secrecy .\nWe ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , but they are not sure .\nWe drive back and forth , frustrated and tired .\nOn the second day , we finally came to a security post .\nBehind , the enormous and devastated land can be seen .\nWe are told that it belongs to the retired General Prabowo Subianto , a man who ran against President Widodo in the last elections , in 2019 , and after being defeated , was elevated to the post of Minister of Defense of the Republic of Indonesia .\nA former Lieutenant-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human rights , in the territories occupied by Java , and in Jakarta itself , where his troops were involved in kidnapping and torturing student protesters .\nSeveral security guards man the post .\nOne of them is called Hambali , a gate security officer employed by the company PT .\nITCI , which is owned by Prabowo Subianto himself .\nBehind the barrier and the post , there is the vast location of the planned city center of the new capital .\nAlthough in theory , this place is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the security personnel immediately go to work , asking us questions , checking IDs , making phone calls to some undisclosed locations .\nOur documents are photocopied .\n\u201c So , is this going to be an Indonesian Dubai ?\n\u201d We ask .\n\u201c Or perhaps Manhattan , or Canberra ?\n\u201d The senior guard utters laconically , before lifting up the barrier and letting us pass : \u201c I just hope that the new capital will be built as planned , although I am not sure that the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Manhattan.\n\u201d The Grandeur : entrance to the new Indonesia capital site ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) Pay as You Go : A new privately owned toll road ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) What follows is a nightmare , combined with Kafkaesque , grotesque images .\nIndonesia always manages to surprise , and to shock me .\nFirst , on the road shoulder , there are several broken trucks , full of timber .\nThe drivers and helpers are busy fixing their engines and tires .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiscriminate logging is obviously going on , up to now .\nOur car moves on ; begins climbing the rolling hills .\nThe devastation is appalling , even by the standards of Borneo/ Kalimantan .\nEntire hills have been deforested , scarred .\nHuge , monstrous stubs of enormous trees line up the road .\nThere are all sorts of makeshift \u2018 reforestation \u2019 projects , obviously conducted to impress the local media .\nThe result of all this is terrifying .\nThe higher we get , the greater the scale of destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen for tens of kilometers , in every direction .\nIf this was once , decades and centuries ago , a paradise , it is now hell .\nOn top of all this , stands a small metal structure , called Sudarmono Tower , put together in the most amateurish manner .\nIt is supposed to resemble the Eiffel Tower .\nLocal people drive here ; they climb it ; adults , children , even grandmothers .\nThere is nothing else to do , in this part of the world : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations , mines and other commercial ventures .\nNow they have new entertainment \u2013 me .\nThey stare , point fingers , repeating , as they always do when they see a foreigner : \u201c bule , bule \u201d ( derogatory for \u201c albino \u201d ) .\nLe Tower de Kalimantan Nouveau \u2013 at the very center of the new capital ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) We approached Ms. Imah , who was visiting the tower together with her family .\nShe is from Sepaku Dua .\nShe has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 colonizing and then plundering \u2019 of Kalimantan .\nIf anything , she is one of the \u2018 colonizers \u2019 , but definitely not one of those who improved their lives by moving to the island .\nShe knows nothing about the \u2018 grand plan \u2019 .\nOr , she knows very little .\nAll she worries about are insignificant details : noise and possible overcrowding : \u201c This is my first time visiting the location of the planned center of the capital .\nPersonally , I am worried about the relocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , we live in a quiet and peaceful environment .\nI am sure there will be more and more people coming and it will become crowded.\n\u201d She does not know that she is living in thorough misery .\nAlmost nobody around here , or even in the middle of the monstrous Jakarta and Surabaya slums , realize their conditions .\n\u2018 Quiet and peaceful \u2019 , she describes her environment .\nWooden shacks , a medical and education system near the hard sub-Saharan African bottom , an entire island robbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ( yes , you are reading correctly ) sold to private businesses .\nMs Ponadi , a shop owner , from Sepaku Village , thinks only about the possible compensation .\nBut she is not even sure that the compensation will be provided by the government : \u201c We came to this village decades ago , as trans-migrants , who started a new life from scratch .\nNow I already have enough land to pass on to my daughters and sons .\nHonestly , I would not be willing if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf we had to move , the government would have to provide adequate compensation , for the hard-earned lives we have built here for decades.\n\u201d This land she is talking about used to belong to this island , and to the people of this island .\nBut she does not understand .\nFirst , the fascist government sent them here , to spread their culture and religion , all around this island , which used to be inhabited by enormous , advanced and clearly socialist cultures .\nNow , the Javanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 investment \u2019 .\nMs. Ponadi concludes , somehow sarcastically : \u201c How could they possibly be able to build a city like Dubai here ?\nI am not convinced at all .\nTall buildings will immediately collapse to the ground \u201d .\nShe laughs , loudly .\nWe don \u2019 t .\nAll this is not funny .\nIt is , somehow , damn serious .\nWe drive through Borneo , exhausted , depressed , and with the feeling that something terrible is once again taking place here .\nFor almost three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people , all over this tremendous island , the 3rd largest on Earth , after Greenland and Papua .\nWe have been documenting mighty rivers like Kapuas , now poisoned by mercury , hills leveled to the ground by mining companies , tremendous sprawls of land deforested , and converted into palm oil plantations .\nChemicals , black carcinogenic creeks , and filth , are everywhere .\nCoal barges exporting the bowels of the island to all corners of the world .\nVillages and towns surrounded by monstrous commercial enterprises .\nBeaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nChildren playing in the middle of the roads .\nSick people running , escaping to the Malaysian part of the island , where the medical care is much better and cheaper .\nFor almost three years , we have been collecting material for a huge documentary film , and a book .\nThe world knows nothing about Borneo ; or almost nothing .\nYet , its demise is as important as that of Amazonia .\nAnd the destruction is much more rapid here , than anything recorded in Brazil .\nOur nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big insanity , and we are alone , totally alone in this : no support and no backing .\nAnd this huge , enormous country all around us , choking us .\nThe Fourth most populous nation on Earth , totally indoctrinated by the pro-Western , pro-business regime , with hardly any diversity , with no mercy , no production and hardly any enthusiasm .\nA country that only consumes , and which lives off cutting down trees , polluting rivers and selling its riches to multi-national companies .\n\u201c I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I prefer the forest to be sustainable .\nEven now they are already destroyed , so what would the forests look like if they really move the capital ?\nKalimantan Island would be more devastated .\nAnd once it gets more devastated , they will move again .\nThat is ridiculous.\n\u201d Yes , they always move again .\nThey come like locust , from Java , supported by Western , foreign , companies .\nThey stay for as long as there is something to plunder .\nThen , they move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not produce , it only plunders , and buys toys for the rich , after selling the loot .\nIt is a terribly frightening sight .\nEverything is make-believe : statistics lie , planners lie .\nThe country has been ransacked , by less than 1 % of the population .\nDeforestation and desolation marks the new center of the future capital city ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) Rainforests are still being clear cut , with no end in sight ( Image : Andre

chemical apocalypse ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) And now , the Indonesian President , a megalomaniac , little businessman from Surakarta ( Solo ) is dreaming about something really huge .\nHe is like some African king who drains his national resources , in order to build a useless , huge palace or a cathedral in the middle of the jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 3 , 2020 , by By Muhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat and Dimas Permadi .\nIt contains two interesting paragraphs : \u201c It is also important to note that domestically Jokowi \u2019 s plan to move the capital has been a contentious issue , which has taken a toll on the president \u2019 s image .\nIn fact , a survey carried out by the KedaiKOPI survey institute revealed that 95.7 percent of Jakartans reject the plan .\nScholars have also argued that the plan is not feasible and would not solve the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , to \u201c elevate \u201d the project , Jokowi selected several unsavory individuals : \u201c To realize this gigantic plan , Jokowi formed a new capital steering board consisting of the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi , Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan , Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son , and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\u201d Jokowi says he loves business , and he is enamored with the U.S. president Donald Trump .\nHe can hardly believe that from a furniture seller he has gone \u2018 so far \u2019 , meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking their hands , telling them how much they are wanted in Indonesia .\nHe talks big .\nHe shuts up his critics .\nJournalists and activists are disappearing , or outrightly getting murdered .\nLaws muzzling any criticism are being introduced , gradually and consistently .\nNobody dares to guess what may come next .\nNew Order ( \u201c Ode Baru \u201d ) \u2013 the fascist pro-business regime of General Suharto , is being re-introduced .\nIn this political climate ; in a climate of fear , intimidation and corruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to rise .\nAs we sit in a car , in silence , driving towards Balikpapan City , my left eye begins to ache .\nIt is just the beginning of a horror which I will have to face in just two weeks from now .\nMy stomach has been destroyed , as always when I work in Indonesia , particularly in Kalimantan .\nSoon , both eyes , attacked by a local parasite , will collapse .\nIt will happen in Hong Kong .\nAnd I will have to fly home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after working in Kalimantan .\nMy journey will take 8 days ; from Hong Kong to Bangkok , to Seoul , Amsterdam , Surinam , Brazil and Peru .\nOn board Lion Air \u2013 the world \u2019 s most crammed and deadliest airline ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) In a few weeks , COVID-19 will come to Indonesia , but instead of mobilizing , Jokowi \u2019 s regime will tell its citizens to pray and drink herbal medicine .\nIn such a situation , a tremendous amount of people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indonesia , unreported .\nBut now we slowly progressed towards the main regional center , and its airport .\nAhead of us , there will be a horrid flight to Pontianak , in two days , on a filthy and overcrowded Boeing 737 , so filthy that it resembles an old bus in some collapsed country .\nThen , a flight to Jakarta on the national carrier Garuda Indonesia , where several people sat around us would be emitting dry , persistent coughs .\nUnlike in the Philippines , Vietnam and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no medical checkpoints , until much , much later .\nIndonesia is a collapsed country .\nI depicted it in my documentary film \u201c DOWNFALL !\n\u201d The fact that it has crumbled is a well-hidden secret .\nIf it does something really well , it obstructs the truth , tricking its own citizens and the world .\nIt shows its true face only when emergencies strike , as basically nothing works there : rescue operations , the medical system , or transportation .\nIndonesia : with such workers \u2013 good luck building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) Before leaving Balikpapan , we talked to several individuals there .\nAlthough in Indonesia , more than half of the population lives in misery ( if international statistics were to apply ) , people here apply standardized neocon \u201c logic \u201d .\nEven in the slums , all over the archipelago , people use stock market jargon .\nIt looks unnatural , terrifying , perverse .\nLusi ( known , like most people in Indonesia , by only one name ) , a housewife , a visitor to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered her \u201c analyses \u201d : \u201c I agree and support the relocation of the capital .\nIt will boost economic development , especially in the property businesses.\n\u201d Would she , personally , participate in the \u201c economic development and property business \u201d ?\nWhen asked , she did not know what to say .\nMr. Arip Harahap , a senior architect , based in Jakarta , declared for this report , that moving the capital from Jakarta to Kalimantan , is \u201c immoral \u201d .\nHe elaborated : \u201c First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning and design process .\nAll technical , socio-cultural studies are still too shallow .\nSecond , considering the country \u2019 s economic situation , it is such a wasteful way of spending a budget .\nThird , it seems that there are the interests of groups close to the central government that will benefit from the project.\n\u201d Apparently , there are many such interests , of many groups close to the government .\nAs the government and such groups are intertwined , forming one system , a regime , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation .\n\u201c The corporations and the oligarchs have a chance to ensure their investments are safe with this project .\nMeanwhile , they ignore the fact the indigenous Paser Balik tribe had their land taken away by ITCI Hutan Manunggal in the 1960s , \u201d Jatam coordinator Merah Johansyah said at the report \u2019 s launch in Jakarta on Tuesday .\nThe names mentioned in the report include lumber businessman Sukanto Tanoto , the owner of ITCI Hutan Manuggal ; Hashim Djojohadikusumo , Prabowo \u2019 s younger brother ; Rheza Herwindo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-House speaker Setya Novanto ; Thomas Aquinas Djiwandono , the treasurer of the Gerindra Party and Prabowo \u2019 s nephew ; lawyer and ex-Justice Minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra ; and the ubiquitous Luhut .\nPresident Joko \u201c Jokowi \u201d Widodo announced the location of the new capital city , at Penajam Paser Utara in East Kalimantan , on April 29 , only 12 days after he won the presidential election .\n\u201c The government never asked for

participation in politics is concerned , \u201d Merah said.\n\u201d Investigating oppression against the indigenous people in Indonesia , as well as the destruction of the environment all over the archipelago by the collusion of local oligarchs , foreign multi-nationals and Indonesian government , is an extremely dangerous job , particularly now , under Jokowi \u2019 s administration .\nPeople

and regional complexities make it difficult to impose the kind of \u2018 one size fit all \u2019 policy which many in Washington DC and some Governors are calling for amid the corona shutdown .\nHere is one such case study .\nCoronavirus fear has cast its dark shadow on the KC metro area ( Image : 21WIRE \u00a9 2020 ) ( KANSAS CITY , MO ) \u2013 The coronavirus crisis continues to rip through the global consciousness , socially isolate millions and cripple economies across the world .\nHere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waits , wonders , and stays shutdown .\nThe Kansas City metropolitan area , or \u201c KC metro \u201d , is comprised of a bi-state area , represented by 14 counties and includes a population of approximately 2.5 million people , according to recent census estimates .\nIt ranks # 31 in size of population compared to other metropolitan statistical areas around the country .\nNobody knows when life will return to normal here in the KC metro , a Midwest conurbation once dubbed the \u201c Paris of the Plains \u201d \u2013 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities nearby , urban areas that are landlocked , varying degrees of access to health care and transportation in each , different industries driving the local economies , and distinct geographic differences across populations .\nThe Federal government \u2019 s one-size-fits-all strategy and response for this crisis does not apply uniformly to areas of the country like the KC metro .\nIf this community , or any other wants a return to normalcy , then it can only happen if it begins to take action on its own by looking at the available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation on the ground , and then acting upon it .\nThis is not what is currently happening in America \u2019 s heartland .\nThe coronavirus crisis has been a ratings boon for media .\nLocal television broadcasters know this and have the public \u2019 s undivided attention for all waking hours of the day as they quarantine at home .\nIn the age of Corona , every newscast has been carefully produced to lead with stories that are anything but optimistic from far away places like China , Italy or New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common theme you \u2019 ll hear from people is \u2018 we are only a few weeks behind \u2019 or \u2018 it \u2019 s only a matter of time \u2019 before the \u2018 peak \u2019 hits and the coronavirus makes catastrophic landfall here the same way it has in some of the largest cities in the world .\nBut the numbers here just don \u2019 t add up .\nKC metro \u2019 s current reported number of COVID-19 infections are well below the numbers we see pumped out by the media for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what other metropolitan areas in the immediate region are facing with their own coronavirus outbreaks , including St. Louis to the east and Denver to the west \u2013 and all three of these metro areas are on the heavily traveled U.S. Interstate 70 highway .\nTo draw a more holistic picture of the current outbreak here , we looked at eight of the most populous counties on both sides of the state line that cluster around the city of Kansas City , Missouri \u2013 the largest urban center and most densely populated area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the two largest counties , Johnson ( KS ) and Jackson ( MO ) counties .\nThe counties of Wyandotte , Douglas , Leavenworth on the Kansas side , and Cass , Clay , Platte on the Missouri side , are also included in these most recent combined numbers : Out of approximately 2.5 million people , these combined numbers begin to tell a specific , different kind of local story .\nLocal media reporting relies mainly on statewide reported COVID-19 numbers , on both sides of the state line , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak in the KC metro \u2014 and that can also be problematic .\nFor example , statewide numbers for Missouri take into account the densely populated county on the eastern side of the state , St. Louis County , which has reported over 1600 positive cases to date .\nThis is compared to its counterpart here on the western part of the state , Jackson County , which has reported over 500 positive cases to date .\nOn the Kansas side , there is one COVID-19 story that has dominated the headlines over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Riverbend Post Acute Rehabilitation Center in Wyandotte county that bills itself as \u201c Kansas City \u2019 s Premier Location for Short-Term Rehabilitation and Long-Term Care \u201d \u2013 in other words , it \u2019 s a nursing home .\nRiverbend is the site of the largest localized outbreak of the coronavirus in all of the KC metro .\nThere are now 110 people connected to the facility , patients and staff , that have tested positive for COVID-19 .\nThat \u2019 s about one-third of all COVID-19 cases for the entire county .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c have died after testing positive for COVID-19 \u201d \u2013 that \u2019 s half of the total deaths reported for the county .\nAerial photo of the Riverbend Post Acute Rehabilitation Center .\nSite of the largest localized outbreak in the KC metro area .\n( Image via https : //riverbendkansascity.com ) The latest \u2018 COVID-19 \u2019 death reported at the center was sadly a 74-year-old woman with a grieving husband and two sons .\nThe husband , who also contracted the coronavirus , we \u2019 re told , had been living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nThe now deceased woman had previously checked into Riverbend several weeks ago to recover from her recent stroke .\nPrior to testing positive for COVID-19 , she had suffered the stroke as well as two heart attacks and a seizure .\nThis is not even close to a reflection of the wider KC metro , but it \u2019 s being used to portray the crisis as something bigger than it really is to justify the current response .\nOn the one hand , there are images of mass panic from far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are isolated cases like Riverbend just miles away .\nThey are both used collectively to reinforce the narrative that extreme social and economic lockdowns are essential to stopping community spread of the virus and ultimately more deaths .\nState and local government response has been , predictably , in lockstep with the Federal government \u2019 s , ordering stringent \u2018 stay-at-home \u2019 and \u2018 social distancing \u2019 orders ( KS and MO orders ) combined with the closure of \u2018 non-essential \u2019 businesses \u2013 suggesting there \u2019 s some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from either direction of the country .\nStatewide orders remain in effect to at least April 19th for Kansas and April 24th for Missouri , with open-ended language in both orders that allows for extensions without any guidelines for evaluating the current threat and what the benefits of an extended lockdown would hope to achieve .\nThe city of Kansas City , Missouri has also issued its own order .\nShoppers social distance with proper protective equipment in the queue on a sunny afternoon .\n( Image : 21WIRE \u00a9 2020 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @

) states know that these other non-lockdown states don \u2019 t ?\nAcceptance of expert projection models plays a pivotal role in their crisis response .\nThese models are not exactly scientific .\nThey are educated guesses .\nBut nonetheless , we \u2019 ll be using them to actually quell the fear around the coronavirus crisis that continues to grip this midwestern enclave .\nIn a recent report published by the Kansas City Star in late March , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri ?\nHow bad will it be ?\nModels show trend \u201d , it was projected that the two states would reach their \u2018 COVID-19 peaks \u2019 on April 28th and May 21st , respectively .\nThat is the day in the future projection when \u2018 deaths per day \u2019 is at its highest number among the population .\nThis projection was based on research from the University of Washington looking at projected levels of hospital resource use , deaths per day and total deaths for all 50 states .\nThis is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Trump \u2019 s White House task force , which includes medical media sensation Dr. Anthony Fauci .\nFauci recently said we should expect that between 100,000 and 200,000 people may die from

not a focus of this report , the hospital system in the KC metro is not over-stressed .\nIn fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sudden and sharp turn upward in coronavirus patients , the system would still be abundantly resourced . ]\nLet \u2019 s take a look at how projections for total number of deaths have plummeted in recent weeks while lockdown orders remain in place : As seen in the graph below , the total number of deaths projected at the time for Kansas \u2019 peak date ( April 28th ) , was 298 \u2013 it has since been adjusted to 214 deaths and the peak date to April 27th .\nKansas currently @

the KC metro to consider changing its course and allow the local economy to reopen ?\nIt has been almost a month since all KC metro schools and most retail businesses have shutdown .\nBoth state governments , Kansas and Missouri , as well as the city government of KCMO , have continued with their stringent \u2018 social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne area police department has even started a hotline for citizens to report \u2018 non-compliant \u2019 businesses , others patrol open spaces enforcing orders with the threat of fines and encourage citizens to report anyone not complying with the

landscape here is littered with window notices .\nSmall businesses are trying new marketing approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting their hours .\nBut for how long can they keep this up ?\n( Image : 21WIRE \u00a9 2020 ) Other small businesses have either outright closed or have begun exploring \u201c new \u201d business models .\n( Image : 21WIRE \u00a9 2020 ) At this local barber shop , unsuspecting

inquiries it has received as \u201c unprecedented \u201d .\nIt was also revealed last week that the agency \u2019 s computer system used to process claims runs on a 60-year-old programming language .\nWhile projections for new coronavirus deaths continue to fall , recent unemployment trends for Kansas and Missouri are steadily on the rise : And in big business news , AMC Theatres , the global @

become impressed with some delusion and run after it .\nThe present response to the coronavirus has led to panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions .\nActing upon incomplete and probably inaccurate information ,

\u201c Chinese flu \u201d has led to policies unheard of in American history with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government can cure anything ( pun intended ) , they are exhibiting symptoms of a disease far more serious than COVID-19 .\nIn slightly more than 200 years , Americans have moved away from self-reliance toward government dependence .\nOur history has been one of people demanding and expecting the government to leave them alone .\nNow , people are requiring the government to take care of them .\nBut at what cost ?\nBeing told that 1 million Montanans are under \u201c house arrest \u201d and

protestations and assurances from Trump \u2019 s national security clique , the public has yet to see any sign of the much-celebrated \u2018 intelligence \u2019 which the White House claims it has , and which was supposedly the basis for the double assassination of Iranian Quds Force leader , General Qasem Soleimani , and senior Iraqi PMU commander , Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis , on January 3rd .\nYesterday , US Defense Secretary Mark Esper joined the growing chorus of Trump officials muttering , I don \u2019 t know .\nAlthough due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month to cash-in with a lucrative board position in the defense industry , Esper now admits that he hasn \u2019 t seen any tangible evidence which indicated that Iran was plotting and planning to strike four US embassies in the Middle East , despite Trump \u2019 s repeated claims the attacks were \u201c imminent.\n\u201d \u201c The president didn \u2019 t cite a specific piece of evidence .\nWhat he said was he believed , \u201d said Esper to CBS News flagship program , Face the Nation on Sunday .\n\u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to four embassies.\n\u201d When pressed again , Esper conceded that the President didn \u2019 t actually cite any intelligence , but that \u201c there probably could have been \u201d some type of threat , although nothing he could cite specifically .\nThat \u2019 s shorthand for , there wasn \u2019 t any .\nFrom there , things continued to get worse for the Defense Secretary .\n\u201c There was intelligence that there was an intent to target the U.S. embassy in Baghdad , \u201d he said .\nHere , Esper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming there was intelligence which had to do with the US Embassy in Baghdad , but which is probably the same chatter from December 30th in the run-up to the US Embassy protests , likely recycled again to justify the subsequent illegal drone assassinations .\nEither way , the \u2018 threat \u2019 was concocted by Trump \u2019 s overly enthusiastic advisors .\nFrom there , Esper retreats to the hollowed ground of true believer .\nIndeed , there is a certain degree of faith required with most things in this Administration .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President believes , and so therefore it must be true .\nThe empirical fiat is simply breathtaking : \u201c What the president said with regard to the four embassies is what I believe as well .\nHe said that he believed that they probably , they could have been targeting the embassies in the region , \u201d said Esper .\n.\nThe New York Times tried to sum-up the folly as follows : Similar fabricated claims of an imminent attack were also made after the fact by recreant US Secretary of State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House press conference , reporters asked Pompeo for specifics on the mystery \u2018 intelligence \u2019 that the White House claims it has .\nPompeo flanked by Trump \u2019 s vexatious Minster of Sanctions , Steve Mnuchin , proceeded to stumble though the questions , and looking more and more like a throwback to the Bush Administration .\nRemember those halcyon days when pathological liars were all the rage ?\n\u201c There is no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qassem Soleimani , \u201d said Pompeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know precisely when , and we don \u2019 t know precisely where , but it was real.\n\u201d When pressed by the interviewer who asked , \u201c Secretary Pompeo , \u201d he was asked , \u201c what is your definition of imminent ?\n\u201d Pompeo could be seen on his back heals , before unconfidently snapping back , \u201c This was gon na happen .\nAmerican lives were at risk.\n\u201d In other words , \u2018 We don \u2019 t need to show you anything .\nYou just have to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed highest ranking diplomat in the country , should be cause for serious concern .\nIt hasn \u2019 t helped that the media have been extremely weak in their pursuit of the truth .\nSEE ALSO : Soleimani Was Pompeo \u2019 s Gulf of Tonkin Incident Language is crucial in order to advance their deception .\nA single word can make or break the facade of a \u2018 legal justification \u2019 used by Washington \u2019 s hawks to wage war .\nIn this case , the key word is \u201c imminent.\n\u201d As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How this narrative was spun by the White House and the State Dept is a good example of how Washington \u2019 s vaunted \u201c IC \u201d ( a reverent abbreviation for the \u2018 Intelligence Community \u2019 ) is able to constantly fall back on a familiar scam , one of the more handy tools in its bag of tricks which is used to explain away to an obedient press and a hapless public .\nThis is achieved by nonchalantly conceding that while there was no single piece of intelligence about an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flotsam and jetsam which collectively constitutes the \u201c mosaic effect \u201d of intelligence that represents a supposed real possibility that such an attack may be on the horizon .\nThe more vague and arbitrary , the better .\nSuch is the nature of \u2018 intelligence \u2019 in 2020 .\nI know , you are probably like me thinking , \u201c what complete and utter bullshit , \u201d but know that one man \u2019 s bullshit is another man \u2019 s mosaic masterpiece .\nSadly , this is what often passes for bona fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCareful not to alienate or admonish the IC , the New York Times authors Peter Baker and carefully construct a soft landing for Pompeo and chums here , skillfully explaining away what is an obvious fraud in a way only \u2018 national security \u2019 journalists can do : So we can safely conclude that there was no intelligence , and no \u201c imminent threat , \u201d and therefore , the assassinations of Soleimani and al-Muhandis were carried out under a false pretext .\nIn any normal country , this would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but a normal country , and certainly not the kind of normal country which Pompeo imagines Iran will blossom into one day .\nCombine this with what we now know \u2013 that Israeli intelligence provided Trump with the key location data which was used to carry out the state-sanctioned murder of Soleimani and al-Muhandis , and a disturbing picture quickly emerges \u2013 one where Washington is carrying out international actions on ever specious grounds .\nSEE ALSO : CONFIRMED : Israeli Supplied Key Intelligence for US Assassination of Soleimani The coverage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case study of how \u2018 national security \u2019 journalism becomes co-opted .\nEven a seemingly conscientious mainstream reporter will still fall-back on the safe side , possibly thinking that , \u2018 Well , we think it might be bullshit , but still have to respect the \u2018 intelligence \u2019 anyway , no matter how spurious it appears to be .\nAs mainstream journalists , we must always adhere to the core narrative , for fear of losing access to our valuable sources inside the IC .\nAt the end of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of IC sources that keeps us employed as mainline journalists.\n\u2019 In other words , this is the perfect example of a self-licking ice cream cone .\nOnce the story is laundered through the various mainstream oracles , then the American public are left with the idea that White House and the State Department might be guilty of \u201c fudging \u201d the intelligence , but because its classified matter , then there \u2019 s no way of really knowing if there was no intelligence .\nUnfortunately , for gallant Resistance leaders heading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes do not rise to the level of high crimes by the Executive Branch , and therefore , not worthy of impeachment .\nAlas , for Democrats , only contrived , non-existent offenses are impeachable .\nSo here we are , back again to square one , with yet another tenuous drive to war , backed by dodgy dossiers , riddled with sexed-up or nonexistent intelligence .\nIn this current hyper-partisan environment , the issue of war can also morph into a political wedge issue , especially if it \u2019 s being framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict between the West and a Muslim country .\nAlready , social media is awash with Trump loyalists deriding Democrat dissenters as \u201d aiding the Ayatollah \u201d of Iran .\nIn this divisive environment , partisan journalists who are normally sympathetic to the antiwar cause but who identify as part of political right , will be afraid to defend Iran and also careful not to push too hard against the White House for fear of being labelled as unpatriotic .\nAt this point , partisan antibodies start to kick in , causing journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby they will equate the behavior of an imperial superpower like the US , with a much smaller and less powerful nation like Iran .\n\u201c Unlike the traitorous Democrats , we \u2019 re not afraid to call out the crimes of the Mullahs !\n\u201d , is the battle cry heard across America \u2019 s conservative talk radio spectrum .\nIn the end , this all serves to preserve American grand strategy for the Middle East and Central Asia .\nSimilarly , their journalistic counterparts on the left may pursue Trump to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond where it undermines Beltway \u2019 s prevailing Middle East policy directives \u2013 currently driven primarily by Israeli and Saudi money and influence .\nUntil journalists and media outlets break free of proscribed partisan boundaries and institutional loyalties , there remains very little hope for a change in Washington \u2019 s worldview .\nOf course , the media will still allow themselves to take a few pot-shots at the Orange Man in the White House , but not at the expense of the Israeli Lobby , the defense industry , and certainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security state \u2019 s long-term objectives .\nFor the mainstream media \u2019 s career stenographers and the establishment \u2019 s loyal opposition , this means preserving the over-arching foreign policy narrative .\nIn the case of RussiaGate and UkraineGate , this is to continually demonize and isolate Russia .\nIn this current standoff with Iran , the priority is also to demonize and isolate the government in Tehran , but also to present Iran as a \u2018 backward \u2019 culture that is in need of modernization and western-style \u2018 democratic reforms.\n\u2019 If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter interferes with any of those long-term policy goals , then the press and political opposition will back off of Trump \u2013 no matter how egregious the war crime or cover-up might be .\nThis was , for the most part , the media \u2019 s unwritten policy under Clinton , Bush , and Obama .\nIf anything , this has been a great lesson into how Washington really works .\nTo any objective observer , it should now be

"Turkey\u2019s Eurasianist Moment: The Importance of Idlib and Russia", "content": "Turkey and Russia have enjoyed a good relationship over the past years .\nThe Islamist President of the Republic , Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( aka the Prez ) , and Russia \u2019 s President Vladimir Putin ( aka the Czar ) have enjoyed very cordial connections in that time \u2013 having spoken approximately 40 times over the phone and about 24 times face-to-face since 2016 \u2018 s Coup-that-was-no-Coup , according to data provided by BBC T\u00fcrk\u00e7e .\nGone are the days that the Republic of Turkey \u2019 s internal and external affairs were encapsulated in Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s famous phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ( 20 April 1931 ) .\nThat was then and this is now , and now is the New Turkey , a nation of believers led by an overly ambitious Tayyip Erdo\u011fan : \u201c Turkey has been at the forefront of the armed effort to unseat Bashar al-Assad from the very beginning .\nEven though in previous years Erdo\u011fan and Assad had been the best of buddies , ever since the supposedly peaceful protests against Damascus came into their own , morphing into Syria \u2019 s not-so civil war , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allawite-led regime in Damascus should fall and be replaced by a Sunni-friendly administration arguably headed by the Muslim Brotherhood and/or its proxies , \u201d as I opined in late 2015 .\nBut then President Putin threw a spanner in the works : \u201c Russian warplanes launched their first airstrikes .\n.\n.\nagainst opposition targets in Syria [ on 30 September 2015 ] , \u201d as reported in the mainstream press at the time .\nAnd subsequently , the Syrian government formally invited the Russians on 2 October 2015 to send in troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jihadi factions , including ISIS or the Islamic State , battling to topple the Damascus government .\nAnd in the context of Russian planes flying in the local sky , a serious diplomatic crisis between Ankara and Moscow occurred \u2013 namely when a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Russian Su-24 that had accidentally intruded into Turkish airspace on 24 November 2015 .\nFollowing this outright emergency , \u201c Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdo\u011fan engaged in a tit-for-tat battle of words about Turkey and its policy aims and goals , \u201d as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not shy attacking his Turkish counterpart : \u201c [ t ] he problem is not the tragedy we witnessed yesterday .\n.\n.\nThe problem is much deeper .\nWe observe .\n.\n.\nthat the current Turkish leadership over a significant number of years has been pursuing a deliberate policy of supporting the \u2018 Islamization \u2019 of their country.\n\u201d This accusation might seem strange in view of the fact that Putin himself is well-known as a champion of the Orthodox Church in Russia .\nThe Czar uttered his words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger accusatory discourse linking Turkey-under-the-AKP to the Islamic State ( or IS/ISIS/ISIL ) and its illegitimate oil deals and weapon shipments.\n\u201d The Prez jocularly responded in kind , saying that \u201c ISIS sells the oil it extracts to Assad .\n[ And t ] hat is also where it gets its money from , \u201d linking Putin \u2019 s Russia to the Islamic State ( or IS/ISIS/ISIL ) .\nFreezing and Thawing and Freezing Again : Russo-Turkish Relations In spite of this duel of words , the two leaders were eventually able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rapprochement could happen though , Putin exerted some pressure on Erdo\u011fan , with Russia hitting Turkey with a raft of sanctions \u2013 a \u201c [ b ] an on import of Turkish fruit and vegetables , poultry and salt .\n[ A b ] an on sale of Russian package holidays to Turkey .\n[ The s ] uspension of construction projects involving Turkish firms in Russia .\n[ As well as r ] estrictions on Turkish citizens working for companies registered in Russia [ and the s ] uspension of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian gas exports to Turkey , \u201d as dutifully listed by the BBC .\nIn this way , the Czar hit the Prez where it hurt , in his country \u2019 s pocketbook .\nAs a result , the latter was duly able to see the error of his ways , which enabled him to come to his senses and tender an apology : \u201c I want to once again express my sympathy and deep condolences to the family of the Russian pilot who died and I say : \u2018 I \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Kremlin statement ( 27 June 2016 ) .\nFor in the aftermath of the downing of the Russian jet \u2013 crashing in the mountainous Jabal Turkman area of the Syrian province of Latakia \u2013 its pilot Lt Col Oleg Peshkov , who had jumped to safety , was killed in the air by an armed group of \u201c Turkmen rebels.\n\u201d These so-called \u201c rebels \u201d formed part of the Jihadi terrorist factions fighting the Assad government .\nThe actual Turkmen shooting down the Russian turned out to be a Turkish citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hailing from the district of Keban in the province of Elaz\u0131\u011f , and even more surprising is the fact that this sharpshooting not-quite Syrian Turkmen even turned out to be the son of a one-time mayor belonging to the ultra-nationalist ( or fascist , if you will ) MHP ( or Party of the Nationalist Movement ) , as indicated by the journalist Tunca \u00d6\u011freten .\nThis political coloration probably explains why \u00c7elik acted as a commander of the Turkmen brigade roaming the countryside .\nAt the moment , the MHP openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political grouping the party espouses an openly racist ( or Turkist , if you will ) agenda .\nAs a Turkist organisation , the MHP always supports and aids each and every social grouping or individual claiming a Turkish ( or broadly Turkist ) identity .\nThe area where the plane was hit just happened to be a region where members of Syria \u2019 s ethnic Turkmen community are living .\nThe Turkish authorities even claimed that the Russian jet that was downed had been taking part in aerial attacks on Turkmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayirbucak ( or Bay\u0131rbucak , in Turkish ) .\nThe Turkish journalist \u00d6\u011freten even asserts that the Turkmen brigades active in the area were at the time fighting and training with the Jihadi terror group Jabhat al-Nusra ( currently known as a \u2018 HTS \u2019 or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ) .\nThe veteran rightist journalist and commentator Taha Akyol explains that the \u201c Syrian Turkmens settled in Syria with the Seljuks [ 1072-1194 ] , the Turkmens at the Bay\u0131r and Bucak regions [ , on the other hand , ] were relocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1299-1922 ] , with the security of the hajj [ pilgrimage ] route and population strategy in .\n.\n.\nmind , \u201d and even adding that \u201c [ f ] or this reason , they have many relatives in Turkey , \u201d which could arguably explain Alparslan \u00c7elik \u2019 s presence on the ground .\nFollowing Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s public apology , things moved pretty quickly .\nTurkey \u2019 s tomato producers were happy again , being able to sell their wares to Russia .\nAKP-led Ankara was again put into position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veritable energy hub were alive again , with plans for a TurkStream pipeline actually coming to fruition some time ago .\nRussian tourists were flocking to Antalya again .\nAnd on a political and diplomatic plane , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s New Turkey joined the big boys at the negotiation table \u2013 as a part of both the Astana Process ( which started on 23-4 January 2017 ) and the Sochi agreement ( 22 October 2019 ) , negotiated settlements that were meant to bring Syria \u2019 s not-so civil war to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a part of the New Cold War realignments , taking its place next Russia , China , and Iran \u2013 a development that led the pro-AKP political scientist Burhanettin Duran , who happens to be heading the Turkish think tank SETA as its general manager , to state that \u201c Turkey \u2019 s Western allies .\n.\n.\neffectively compelled the Turks to work more closely with Moscow and Tehran \u201d ( 6 October 2017 ) .\nAt that stage , Dr Duran said that Turkey seemed to be \u201c shifting toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that it is \u201c not possible to ignore the differences of opinion between Russia and Iran.\n\u201d And the present sudden cooling of the Russo-Turkish love affair all but underlines Duran \u2019 s reservations .\nThe latest developments in Syria \u2019 s not-so civil war next door suddenly soured relations \u2013 so much so that the Turkish writer Burak Tuygan recently even proposed that \u201c this [ Turco-Russian ] honeymoon could not last long , \u201d particularly now with the \u201c emergence of the developments in Idlib \u201d ( 12 February 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense made no bones about this , releasing a statement saying that \u201c reason for the crisis in the Idlib de-escalation zone unfortunately is the non-fulfilment by our Turkish colleagues of their undertakings to separate moderate opposition militants from terrorists , \u201d a key component of the Sochi agreement .\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov , for his part , added that \u201c according to [ the Sochi agreement ] , the Turkish side undertook to ensure that terrorist groups in Idlib were neutralised .\nWe continue to note with regret that these groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syrian forces and also taking aggressive action against our military facilities , \u201d adding ominously that \u201c [ t ] his is unacceptable.\n\u201d Sochi and Idlib : One Man \u2019 s Terrorist is Another Man \u2019 s Freedom Fighter As such , one can but wonder about Russia and its intentions , as Turkey had been given an impossible task \u2013 to separate \u201c moderate opposition militants from terrorists \u201d \u2013 given that the mere concept of \u2018 moderate opposition \u2019 seems alien to the reality on the ground , and particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US envoy Brett McGurk stated on the record that \u201c Idlib provice is the largest al-Qaeda safe-haven since 9/11 , tied directly to Ayman al Zawahiri , this is a huge problem \u201d ( 27 July 2017 ) .\nAnd that seems to be the reason behind the Prez \u2019 s current intransigent stance on Idlib , for I have argued elsewhere that he all but sees the \u201c Syrian Theatre as a Laboratory for [ his ] Islamist Agenda.\n\u201d The already mentioned grouping HTS or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham effectively controls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player , \u2019 imposing its network of Sharia courts on Idlib \u2019 s population .\nNext to HTS , a whole host of other small Jihad terror factions is active in the province \u2013 such as the Jabhat al-Wataniya lil-Tahrir ( or National Liberation Front/NLF ) , which the BBC calls a \u201c Turkish-backed rebel alliance , \u201d which arguably denotes its nominal connection with the so-called FSA ( or al-Jaysh as-S\u016br\u012b al-\u1e24urr or Free Syrian Army ) now somewhat disingenuously renamed as the SNA ( or al-Jaysh al-Watani as-S\u016br\u012b or Syrian National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guardians of Religion ) ; and significantly , the TIP ( or Hizb al-Islami al-Turkistani or Turkistan Islamic Party ) .\nIn connection with the latter grouping , the HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani ( Ahmed Hussein al-Shar \u2019 a ) had this to say in a recent interview with the International Crisis Group ( ICG ) : \u201c As for the Turkistan Islamic Party , things are a little different .\nThese guys have been in Syria for seven years and have never constituted a threat to the outside world .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime aggression .\nAs Uighurs , they face persecution in China \u2013 which we strongly condemn \u2013 and they have nowhere else to go .\nOf course , I sympathise with them .\nBut their struggle in China is not ours , so we tell them that they are welcome here as long as they abide by our rules \u2013 which they do.\n\u201d In other words , I would argue that Turkey , or at the very least , the now firmly AKP-aligned MHP or its popular formations known as the Grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Turkish ) have been instrumental in transporting these Islamist Uighurs to the Syrian theatre where they enthusiastically joined the Jihad against Assad as a kind of displaced fight against the Chinese authorities back home in Xinjiang .\nThis is explained by the San Francisco-based author Chris Kanthan : \u201c [ f ] rom 2009 to 2015 , there were a lot of terrorist attacks by the [ Uighur ] jihadists ( here \u2019 s an example ) .\nThat \u2019 s when China decided to really crack down .\nDuring the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicalized [ Uighur ] Muslims went to Syria and joined ISIS to fight Assad , \u201d with the aid of the New Turkey \u2019 s now government-allied Grey Wolves , no doubt .\nPublicly though , the Prez shies away from endorsing any kind of Islamist or Jihadi agenda in Syria , instead uttering words expressive of quite different goals and intentions : \u201c [ o ] ur military observation posts play a vital role [ in Idlib ] and they shall remain in place .\n.\n.\nwe have informed [ the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ the realisation of ] a civil massacre and a [ new ] migratory wave [ of refugees ] .\n\u201d Tayyip Erdo\u011fan made these announcements on 3 February 2020 , while visiting the Ukraine .\nIn fact , the Turkish President is really playing with fire , as on the previous day , the Turkish government pledged aid consisting of TL 200 million ( $ 33.4 million ) to be spent on the needs of the Ukrainian army , as confirmed by the Ukrainian Ambassador to Turkey , Andrey Sibiga .\nGiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country where pro-Russian forces are facing the onslaught of the Ukrainian army as well as far-right armed groups such as the Azov Battalion \u2013 a conflict which the West likes to portray as an example of \u201c Russian aggression \u201d \u2013 this sample of Turkish generosity can not be seen as anything but the Prez standing up to and challenging the Czar .\nWhereas , with regard to Syria , the messages broadcast by Erdo\u011fan convey broadly humanitarian concerns ( with possible massacres and refugee crises ) , even implying that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has installed on Syrian territories only function as guaranteeing AKP-led Ankara \u2019 s philanthropic considerations for Idlib \u2019 s population .\nIn reality though , these much-vaunted incursions of Syrian sovereignty do not even appear to have been part of Turkish government policy or even an initiative of Turkey \u2019 s Armed Forces ( TSK ) .\nInstead , erecting observation posts all across Idlib was an idea that Tayyip Erdo\u011fan received from his close adviser Adnan Tanr\u0131verdi and the organisation he founded and supervises , SADAT A.\u015e .\nThis organsation presents itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in Turkey , that internationally provides consultancy and military training services at the international defense and interior security sector.\n\u201d In other words , rather than fulfilling either a strategic or tactical function within Turkey \u2019 s military designs in Syria , the posts appear to have sprung-up in response to an operation designed and facilitated by a private entity and paid for by the Turkish state .\nIn this way , the traditional love for privatisation displayed by the AKP has now also become part of Turkey \u2019 s military operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also privatised the business of war .\nIn a way , this revamping of Turkish military affairs seems to echo Donald Rumsfeld \u2019 s plans originally voiced on 10 September 2001 .\nAnd this means that a move interpreted by many as proving the New Turkey \u2019 s expansionist leanings is in reality part of a wider money-making scheme concocted by one of the Prez \u2019 s henchmen \u2013 Adnan Tanr\u0131verdi , the man who late last year caused quite a stir in the country as he had publicly stated that \u201c [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the coming of the Mahdi.\n\u201d To be clear , I would like to remind everybody that both \u201c Sunni Muslims and Shia are awaiting a person who is referred to as Al-Mahdi ( Shia call him Imam Mahdi because they are expecting him to be their 12th Imam ) .\n.\n.\nThere is no Hadith that tells us explicitly the actual name of the Mahdi , \u201d as can be read on the website Discovering Islam .\nRussia and Turkey : Neighbours , Rivals , and Enemies or Friends Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had a troubled relationship with Russia for a long time \u2013 indeed , a very long time , if we want to put our trust in Professor Dr Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k ( 1916-2026 ) , Turkey \u2019 s godfather of Ottoman history and historiography , who penned a scholarly article back in 1947 , pointing to the year 1569 as marking the beginning of the \u201c Ottoman\u2013Russian Rivalry.\n\u201d A rivalry that was to lead to open warfare a little more than a century later ( 1677-78 ) .\nAnd today \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veritable love-hate relationship with its northern neighbour .\nWhereas Turkey is oftentimes seen as a bridge straddling Europe and Asia , Russia as a political and cultural construct is understood as occupying a \u201c dual or median position between Europe and Asia , \u201d as expressed by the well-respected Russia specialist Dr Marlene Laruelle .\nThese obtuse words ( or this exercise in downright academic verbiage ) seem to denote that Russian Westernisation moved along more quickly than had been the case for Turkey ( or its Ottoman imperial predecessor ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1682-1725 ) appears to have single-handedly initiated if not achieved this feat of material and cultural transformation , by \u201c forcing Russia into the western world , \u201d as worded by the eminent historian B. H. Sumner ( 1893-1951 ) in 1950 .\nIn this way , Czar Peter once and for all removed Mother Russia from the Orient where she had previously assumed the position of the defunct \u2018 Byzantine Empire \u2019 ( 330-1453 ) as the local Christian Orthodox powerhouse .\nIn her new book , Reclaiming Byzantium , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial Russia opened one of the world \u2019 s leading centres for Byzantine archaeology in Istanbul [ in 1894 ] , the Russian Archaeological Institute \u2013 its purpose was to stake the claim that Russia was the correct heir to \u2018 Czargrad \u2019 ( as Istanbul was referred to in Russian circles ) .\n\u201d Dr \u00dcre \u2019 s work adds a religious dimension to the tension present between Moscow and Istanbul ( nowadays , Ankara of course ) , a dimension that very likely has not escaped President Putin \u2019 s attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he \u2018 has been pushing an Orthodox agenda at home ever since he came to power at the end of the year 1999.\n\u2019 Still , away from such religious or ideological spheres , in terms of modernisation as Westernisation , the Ottomans ( or Turkey , if you will ) have been lagging behind , as they were only able to enter the European Concert of Nations about a century later than their northern neighbours \u2013 like Peter the Great , Sultan Mahmud II ( 1808-39 ) forced his subjects to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure of the Ottoman Empire .\nWesternization in the real sense began during his reign , \u201d as declared by the popular Turkish historian Erhan Afyoncu .\nSultan Mahmud \u2019 s son and successor Abd\u00fclmecid ( 1839-61 ) proclaimed the G\u00fclhane Imperial Edict which led directly to the Tanzimat reforms ( 1839-76 ) that thoroughly modernized the Ottoman state and its institutions .\nThese two neighbours located at Europe \u2019 s eastern flank thus both went though a process of drastic modernisation as Westernisation only to find themselves at loggerheads with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russo-Ottoman wars took place between the late 17th and the late 19th centuries .\n.\n.\nRussia [ has been ] at war with the Ottoman Empire .\n.\n.\nmore frequently .\n.\n.\nthan with any other power , \u201d explains the historian Victor Taki .\nIn his 2016 book Tsar and Sultan , Dr Taki even reasons that primarily textual \u201c representations of the brutal realities of the Russo-Turkish conflicts contributed to the Orientalization of the Ottoman Empire [ in Russian eyes ] and helped to construct Russian identity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These words show to what extent the two neighbours have really been inter-dependent , though mostly in a hostile fashion , for long swathes of time .\nIn the aftermath of the Great War though , the Soviet Union ( as the successor to the Russian Empire ) was at first on friendly terms with its southern neighbour , even providing logistical and other support to the Turkish resistance movement led by Mustafa Kemal ( to be known as Atat\u00fcrk , 1881-1938 ) .\nFollowing the establishment of the Republic of Turkey ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was signed in 1925 , which was renewed in 1929 , 1931 , and 1935 , with the Soviet Union even providing technical assistance and interest-free loans .\nThe outbreak of the Second World War ( 1939-45 ) caused Turkey to engage in a wide of variety of diplomatic manoeuvres which enabled the country to remain neutral till the very end .\nAs the end of World War II gave way to the Cold War between east and west , with the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan ( August 1945 ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict , as deftly argued by Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick in their magisterial Untold History of the United States .\nAs a result , the Turkish Republic which had just joined the allied side , was drafted into service as a buffer-head against the Communist East .\nIn the aftermath of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union , Turkey profited greatly from commercial ties and exchanges with the new states to its north and north-east .\nStill , political relations were tense , particularly as Russia violently subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow and the Russian Federation ( 1994-97 , 1999-2009 ) .\nAs Muslims and , as numerous Chechen refugees that had fled for the Ottoman lands whose descendants are now Turks ( or Turkish citizens , if you will ) , the Republic also felt morally obliged to support the Chechen position against Russia .\nBut eventually , as outlined above , Erdo\u011fan-led Turkey came to an agreement with Putin-led Russia .\nBut now , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s open support for Jihadi terrorist activity in Idlib has put a strain on Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been somewhat shaky to begin with in view of the Turkish President \u2019 s now tedious history of vilifying his Syrian counterpart and Russia \u2019 s open espousal of the Damascus government .\nThe Syrian Arab Army ( or SAA ) has been acting against the Turkish observation points in Idlib , which basically constitute a legitimate casus belli as they compose a foreign occupation of home soil , as far as the Assad government is concerned : \u201c [ t ] he SAA has been encircling Turkish observation posts since August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria \u2019 s Russian ally has been equally vocal and forthright about Turkey , its incursion and non-compliance with earlier-made agreements .\nBurak Tuygan \u2019 s earlier-mentioned claim that the Turco-Russian honeymoon is over , did however not take account of the Prez \u2019 s incredible dancing skills which allow him to pirouette back and forth between east and west , between Moscow and Washington , between Putin and Trump .\nAnd this uncanny ability led to a top-level meeting between Turkish and Russian delegations in Moscow on 17-18 February .\nAlas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real outcome , as subsequently voiced by the AKP spokesman \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n : \u201c [ t ] here was no satisfactory outcome for Turkey from the meetings with Russia over Syria \u2019 s Idlib .\nWe rejected the paper and map offered to us.\n\u201d In the next instance , Erdo\u011fan proposed a multilateral meeting on 5 March .\nThe news agency Reuters reports that the \u201c German and French leaders expressed concern about the humanitarian situation in Idlib and urged an end to the conflict , while the Kremlin said it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit \u201d on 4 March 2020 .\nAt the same time , Turkey \u2019 s President has been in touch with his American counterpart , asking for air support and \u201c for two batteries of Patriot missile systems to shield its border area from air attacks.\n\u201d In other words , the Prez keeps performing his breath-taking pirouettes , but one can not but wonder how long he will be able to stay in the air like that .\nAssessing these recent Turco-Russian travails , the H\u00fcrriyet Daily News columnist Bar\u00e7\u0131n Yinan\u00e7 recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an utterly cynical fashion , that \u201c Russian President Vladimir Putin will definitely find a way that Turkey will present as a compromise to its own public.\n\u201d Yinan\u00e7 thus thinks that the Czar will come up with a way for the Prez to save face so that Turkey will be able to have its cake and eat it too .\nWill Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s support for the Jihad against Assad spell his end on the international scene possibly leading to a domestic debacle as well , or will he yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continue ruling his land with an iron fist and an open palm , freely handing out gifts to his supporters and believers ?\n!\n?\nWill Erdo\u011fan succumb to the \u2018 Assad must go \u2019 curse or will he instead continue riding into the sunset ?\n!\n?\n?\nAs per usual , only time will tell .\n*** 21WIRE special

the coronavirus illness , now called COVID-19 .\nAs the reported numbers grow , so does widespread nervousness , often in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet paper , canned goods .\nWe are told to accept the testing results as science-based .\nWhile it is next to impossible to get a full picture of what is taking place in China , the center of the novel virus storm , there is a process , being fed by mainstream media accounts and genuine panic in populations unclear what the real dangers are , that has alarming implications for the post-pandemic future .\nDuring the last week of January the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) ordered an unprecedented lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , Wuhan , in an attempt to contain a public health situation that had clearly gotten out of control .\nNever before in the history of modern public health had a government placed an entire city in quarantine by imposing a cordon sanitaire around it .\nThat lock down was quickly extended to other China cities to the extent that , for the past weeks , a major part of the world \u2019 s second largest national economy has shut down .\nThat in turn is impacting the global economy .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first deaths are being reported in countries outside of China , especially in South Korea , Japan , Iran and Italy , the prime question everyone has is how dangerous this virus is .\nThe fiasco with the US CDC , where the putative tests for the novel virus were shown defective , underscores the fact that the testing for the now-named virus , SARS-CoV-2 , said to cause the disease called COVID-19 , is anything but 100 % reliable .\nDespite this , influenced by a steady stream of mainstream media images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of police cordons around Washington State nursing homes said to house several presumed Coronavirus patients , of pictures of Iranian hospitals filled with body bags , millions of citizens are understandably becoming alarmed and fearful .\nPanic buying and threats of scarcity features heavily in a sustained corporate mainstream media campaign of fear ( Image : NEO ) What is being done in city after city and country after country is cancellation of major events where many people come together .\nThis has included the Venice Carnival , major sports events , trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMajor airlines are being financially devastated as people around the world cancel holiday flights

.\nWHO warns about paper money contagion risk .\nCountries are introducing laws such as in the UK allowing legal detention of citizens who might have a virus .\nGrowing media promotion in the West of shop shelves bare of everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet paper is feeding panic buying everywhere .\nIt is important to have a perspective on the apparent deaths provably due to COVID-19 .\nHere facts become very imprecise .\nAs of March 3 , 2020 according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom , worldwide there were a total of 90,893 cases of COVID-19 , with 3,110 resulting in death .\nHe then called this a 3.4 % mortality rate , a figure highly disputed by other health experts .\nTedros stated , \u201c Globally , about 3.4 % of reported COVID-19 cases have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally kills far fewer than 1 % of those infected.\n\u201d The problem is that no one can say precisely what the true death rate is .\nThat \u2019 s because globally we have not tested all who might have mild cases of the virus and the accuracy of those tests are anything but 100 % certain .\nBut a statement about a death rate more than three times that of seasonal flu is a real panic-maker if true .\nThe reality is very likely a far lower true mortality according to epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the cases , \u201d says Professor John Edmunds of the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine .\n\u201c In fact , we only usually report a small proportion of them .\nIf there are many more cases in reality , then the case fatality ratio will be lower.\n\u201d Edmunds went on to say , \u201c What you can safely say [ \u2026 ] is that if you divide the number of reported deaths by the number of reported cases [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will almost certainly get the wrong answer.\n\u201d The WHO under Tedros seems to be erring on the side of spreading panic .\nThe WHO and the USA CDC some years ago changed the definition of deaths from seasonal flu to \u201c deaths of flu or pneumonia.\n\u201d The CDC calculates only an approximate flu death count by totaling death certificates processed that list \u201c pneumonia or influenza \u201d as the underlying or contributing cause of death .\nThe CDC estimates 45 Million Flu Cases , and 61,000 what they deftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Flu Season .\nHow many were elderly with pneumonia or other lung diseases is unclear .\nNaturally the numbers help spread fear and sell seasonal flu vaccines whose positive effect is anything but proven .\nWorldwide , the CDC estimated in a study in 2017 that , \u201c between 291,000 and 646,000 people worldwide die from seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses each year.\n\u201d In China alone the estimate for seasonal influenza-associated ( including pneumonia ) deaths was about 300,000 in 2018 .\nNote that 3,000 corona-attributed deaths , as tragic as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c normal \u201d annual deaths from lung-related illnesses in China , and because of the mixed or changing China accounting , it is not clear how many of the 3,000 China deaths are even from seasonal pneumonia .\nBut owing to dramatic videos , not verifiable , of people allegedly dropping dead on the streets in China , with no proof , or of Wuhan hospitals filled in the corridors with body bags apparently of dead from COVID-19 , much of the world is understandably anxious about this strange exogenous invader .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-meaning health officials and likely opportunism by Western vaccine makers like GlaxoSmithKline or Gilead and others , with alarming speed our world is being transformed in ways just months ago we could not have imagined .\nWhatever has occurred inside China at this point it is almost impossible to say owing to conflicting reactions of the Beijing authorities and several changes in ways of counting COVID-19 cases .\nThe question now is how the relevant authorities in the West will use this crisis .\nHere it is useful to go back to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Rockefeller Foundation , one of the world \u2019 s leading backers of eugenics , and creators of GMO among other things .\nThe report in question has the bland title , \u201c Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.\n\u201d It was published in May 2010 in cooperation with the Global Business Network of futurologist Peter Schwartz .\nThe report contains various futurist scenarios developed by Schwartz and company .\nOne scenario carries the intriguing title , \u201c LOCK STEP : A world of tighter top-down government control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing citizen pushback.\n\u201d Here it gets interesting as in what some term predictive programming .\nThen the scenario gets very interesting : A relevant question is whether certain bad actors , and there are some in this world , are opportunistically using the widespread fears around the COVID-19 to advance an agenda of \u201c lock step \u201d top down social

the greatest pandemic in recorded history could help us in the weeks and months ahead .\nPut simply , medics found that severely ill flu patients nursed outdoors recovered better than those treated indoors .\nA combination of fresh air and sunlight seems to have prevented deaths among patients ; and infections among medical staff .\n[ 1 ] There is scientific support for this .\nResearch shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fresh air can kill the flu virus and other harmful germs .\nEqually , sunlight is germicidal and there is now evidence it can kill the flu virus .\nDuring the great pandemic , two of the worst places to be were military barracks and troop-ships .\nOvercrowding and bad ventilation put soldiers and sailors at high risk of catching influenza and the other infections that often

putting them in tents .\nAnd in good weather they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun .\nAt this time , it was common practice to put sick soldiers outdoors .\nOpen-air therapy , as it was known , was widely used on casualties from the Western Front .\nAnd it became the treatment of choice for another common and often deadly respiratory infection of the time ; tuberculosis .\nPatients were put outside in their beds to breathe fresh outdoor air .\nOr they were nursed in cross-ventilated wards with the windows open day and night .\nThe open-air regimen remained popular until antibiotics

socialist-leaning government like Venezuela for collective punishment : \u201c A preoccupation with containing communism , and the change in the relative U.S. power in the world explain much of the evolution in U.S. relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years.\n\u201d [ 8 ] Therefore , it should come as little surprise then that the current neocon-dominated Trump administration in Washington is behind this latest reckless and vindictive IMF decision \u2013 one which certainly will result in increased hardship and loss of life in South America .\nThe International Monetary Fund on Tuesday rejected economically devastated Venezuela \u2019 s request for a $ 5 billion loan to help it cope with the onslaught of coronavirus on the country that an aid agency warned is as prepared as war-torn Syria .\nPresident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , in a statement hours later , the Washington-based institution indirectly cited a dispute over Maduro \u2019 s leadership in denying his petition .\nIn a letter to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva , Maduro said a $ 5 billion loan from the IMF \u2019 s Rapid Financing Instrument ( RFI ) \u201c will contribute significantly to strengthening our detection and response systems.\n\u201d It was the country \u2019 s first loan request to the IMF since 2001 .\n\u201c Unfortunately , the Fund is not in a position to consider this request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity \u201d on international recognition of the country \u2019 s government , the Washington-based institution said in a statement .\n\u201c As we have mentioned before , IMF engagement with member countries is predicated on official government recognition by the international community , as reflected in the IMF \u2019 s membership .\nThere is no clarity on recognition at this time , \u201d the statement said .\nMore than 50 countries including the United States have not recognized Maduro for more than a year , after switching allegiance to opposition leader Juan Guaido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branded Maduro a usurper over the president \u2019 s 2018 re-election in polls widely seen as fraudulent .\nBut US sanctions and other international pressures have failed to dislodge Maduro , who is backed by Venezuela \u2019 s creditors China and Russia and retains the support of the powerful military .\nThe RFI from which Maduro sought the assistance is a mechanism by which all IMF member countries can get financial assistance without the need to have a full-fledged economic program in place .\nVenezuela \u2019 s health system is in tatters after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has sent millions of people fleeing for lack of basic staples .\n\u201c We hardly have five percent of the medicine stocks we need , \u201d Douglas Leon Natera , head of the Venezuelan Medical Federation , told AFP earlier .\nJan Egeland , general secretary of the Norwegian Refugee Council , placed Venezuela in the same category as war-torn Syria and Yemen in its preparedness .\nLike those countries , \u201c there will be carnage \u201d when the virus reaches parts of Venezuela given that \u201c health systems have collapsed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 reported coronavirus cases , according to John Hopkins \u2019 global tally , and Maduro has ordered a lockdown in the capital Caracas and six other states .\n\u201c At this crucial moment and aware of the high level of contagion of this disease , we will continue to take rapid and vigorous measures \u201d to stop the advance of the pandemic , Maduro wrote in his letter to Georgieva .\n\u201c We are convinced that in permanent coordination with the WHO ( World Health Organization ) and the support among the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to overcome this difficult situation.\n\u201d The country has banned flights to and from Europe , as well as Colombia , Panama and the Dominican Republic .\nIt has also suspended school and university classes as well as sports events .", "author": "21wire", "url":

re-offend , especially if it is a violent crime , whereby the issue would quickly elevate to the level of national news story .\nTo make maters even more potentially complicated , many governments and law enforcement districts have announced that they will also be making fewer new arrests , supposedly to lighten the burden on police and first responders , as well as government resources @ @ @ @ @ @

\u201c Every generation has a 100 percent mortality rate.\n\u201d The current \u201c pandemic \u201d can be used to illustrate societal problems more destructive than disease .\nHow Americans view the role of government in their lives and their belief that government can fix anything , including their mortality , demonstrates the madness that inflicts people when they become impressed with some delusion and run after it .\nThe present response to the coronavirus has led to panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions .\nActing upon incomplete and probably inaccurate information , our government has embarked upon a spending spree and encroachment on the liberties of Americans of massive proportions .\nLogic would dictate that from now on , every flu season , our economy must shut down and the government print , thereby inflating , more money and spend it on non-productive transfers .\nThe sphere of liberty shrinks as the size of government grows .\nThe current response to \u201c Chinese flu \u201d has led to policies unheard of in American history with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government can cure anything ( pun intended ) , they are exhibiting symptoms of a disease far more serious than COVID-19 .\nIn slightly more than 200 years , Americans have moved away from self-reliance toward government dependence .\nOur history has been one of people demanding and expecting the government to leave them alone .\nNow , people are requiring the government to take care of them .\nBut at what cost ?\nBeing told that 1 million Montanans are under \u201c house arrest \u201d and that every \u201c non-essential \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrational response to save the lives of a few .\nThe logic displayed during this current \u201c pandemic \u201d would necessitate that nothing ever be allowed that would put more than 1 percent of a given population at risk .\nSo , driving cars must be banned , no American lives can be risked defending freedom , and high cholesterol foods taken off the shelves .\nThe assumption that the government can and should take care of your needs is a subtle destroyer of the American spirit .\nSuch a childlike attitude changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erodes the resilience of people to deal with a crisis .\nWho will rescue us from our rescuers ?\nWe did not vote on the \u201c shelter-in-place \u201d dictum .\nWe did not vote on the shut down of all \u201c non-essential \u201d businesses .\nHysteria leads to a dismissal of the factual .\nAnd the factual analysis of this current \u201c Wuhan flu \u201d is that many of the policies enacted here in Montana are irrational and insulting .\nDoes anyone believe that the \u201c vulnerable \u201d ( such as this mid-70s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate precautions on their own without the governor destroying the livelihoods of all our fellow Montanans ?\nDoes anyone really expect now that a governor has assumed the power to decide who is essential or not , that future governors will not expand on such policies ?\nIncreasing dependence on government and passively accepting that some \u201c elite \u201d somewhere knows best about our welfare is much more dangerous than the Wuhan virus .\nThe natural

, Iran ( Photo : Farsnews.ir/Behzad Alipour Wikicommons ) It was front-page news this week that China has revised the coronavirus death toll for the city of Wuhan , the original epicentre of the outbreak .\nThree days earlier , New York City also revised its coronavirus death figures .\nWuhan \u2019 s death toll jumped by 50 % ; New York \u2019 s jumped by 17 % .\nIn both cases , the change in the death toll reflected inclusion of \u201c probable \u201d or \u201c suspected \u201d cases of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus .\nThis is consistent with recent World Health Organization guidelines instructing certifiers to record COVID-19 on death certificates in the absence of testing , including where the disease is only \u201c assumed to have caused , or contributed to death.\n\u201d Whether taking their cues from the WHO or not , many nations are recording deaths of suspected and probable COVID-19 cases as deaths due to COVID-19 .\n.\nFor example , in the United States , Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) adopted the WHO stance on March 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOther countries , such as Britain and Ireland , had already designated COVID-19 as a \u201c notifiable \u201d disease , requiring it to be listed on death certificates wherever it is present .\nTherefore , the death toll figures being used to drive \u2018 lockdown \u2019 policies and other coronavirus response measures include significant numbers of unconfirmed cases , as well as cases with serious complicating factors ( long-term chronic medical and respiratory conditions ) , potentially exaggerating the danger or role played by COVID-19 in the actual cause of death .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ no unique symptoms of its own ( the most common being fever and cough , which can have various causes ) .\nThis undoubtedly adds a great degree of difficulty to the job of physicians trying to determine \u201c probable \u201d cases of the disease .\nFaced with the death of a patient , determining the cause of death may not be straightforward \u2014 especially where the patient has long-term health conditions ( comorbidities ) affecting a patient \u2019 s outcome .\nFor context , most of the coronavirus deaths in Italy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % ) and USA ( 99.1 % ) involve other health conditions .\nIn light of this , these judgement calls by physicians , as well as the way in which they are being required to fill in death certificates , are vitally important to getting an accurate picture of COVID-19 mortality without including deaths from other causes .\nOn the situation in the UK , professor of pathology Dr John Lee wrote in The Spectator : \u201c If someone dies of a respiratory infection in the UK , the specific cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the illness is a rare \u2018 notifiable disease \u2019 .\nSo the vast majority of respiratory deaths in the UK are recorded as bronchopneumonia , pneumonia , old age or a similar designation .\nWe don \u2019 t really test for flu , or other seasonal infections .\nIf the patient has , say , cancer , motor neurone disease or another serious disease , this will be recorded as the cause of death , even if the final illness was a respiratory infection .\nThis means UK certifications normally under-record deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what has happened since the emergence of Covid-19 .\nThe list of notifiable diseases has been updated .\nThis list \u2014 as well as containing smallpox ( which has been extinct for many years ) and conditions such as anthrax , brucellosis , plague and rabies ( which most UK doctors will never see in their entire careers ) \u2014 has now been amended to include Covid-19 .\nBut not flu .\nThat means every positive test for Covid-19 must be notified , in a way that it just would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the current climate , anyone with a positive test for Covid-19 will certainly be known to clinical staff looking after them : if any of these patients dies , staff will have to record the Covid-19 designation on the death certificate \u2014 contrary to usual practice for most infections of this kind .\nThere is a big difference between Covid-19 causing death , and Covid-19 being found in someone who died of other causes .\nMaking Covid-19 notifiable might give the appearance of it causing increasing numbers of deaths , whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear far more of a killer than flu , simply because of the way deaths are recorded.\n\u201d The question needs to be asked , how many deaths being attributed to COVID-19 are \u201c probable \u201d cases , diagnosed with no test on the basis of non-unique symptoms , because the WHO as well as national health authorities have instructed physicians to record deaths this way ?\nHow many serious health conditions are being minimized so that all \u201c COVID-19 deaths \u201d can be captured ?\nAnd what part is played by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially skewing these figures ?\nIn the wake of the change to Wuhan \u2019 s death toll , various media outlets are questioning the Chinese government \u2019 s honesty and transparency , with frequent mentions of a possible cover-up of the real numbers .\nWhile the Chinese have explained the discrepancy as a function of statistics catching up to reality , western media outlets are questioning the veracity of China \u2019 s statistics altogether .\nAmid such questions , nobody seems to be asking what part the World Health Organisation guidelines played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to New York , it may be no surprise that no such questions about transparency are being floated by the MSM .\nHowever our question remains : what part is played by the WHO in affecting the way deaths are recorded , and therefore the way the COVID-19 death toll is calculated ?\nUltimately , this is just more evidence that the various death tolls , projections , curves to be \u201c flattened \u201d and other statistics surrounding the pandemic are not necessarily incontrovertible \u201c science \u201d but in fact largely just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may or may not be borne out by reality .", "author": "Featured News", "url":

to shutdown the country was never based on actual science .\nThe Oxford professor also explains how government experts have been \u2018 consistently wrong \u2019 throughout the crisis , and even revealed how UK ministers descended into panic , and appeared to have \u2018 lost sight of the evidence \u2019 \u2013 as they rushed the country into a full national quarantine even though they had access to , and were being briefed with , accurate data which showed the crisis had already peaked .\nHeneghan also stated that some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u2018 hold their nerve \u2019 while eschewing popular \u2018 doomsday scenarios \u2019 which were being pushed incessantly by governments and media in order to justify draconian lockdown policies .\nThe Scandinavian country has recorded just 392 new patients and 40 deaths today , approximately 10 per cent of the UK totals .\nBritain \u2019 s diagnoses have not been announced yet .\nIn an interview with the UK Mail Online , Prof Heneghan stated : \u201c The peak of deaths occurred on April 8 , and if you understand that then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections .\nThat would be 21 days before then , right before the point of lockdown.\n\u201d \u201c Consistent with previous analyses , the peak day of deaths was the 8th of April .\nThe structure of the data is similar across the regions , with the peak in London on the 4th of April , four days ahead of the rest of the country , the 8th of April.\n\u201d \u2013 Carl Heneghan and Jason Oke , Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine .\nHe claims that if the Government accepts that deaths peaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that infections were at their highest around three weeks prior .\nData shows the rate of Britons with upper respiratory tract infections dropped from 20 per 100,000 people on March 15 to around 12 per 100,000 just six days later .\nThe figures do not relate solely to coronavirus but may be a good indicator because so few people were being tested for the deadly infection .\nAll along , the UK government , now led by caretaker PM Dominic Raab , has been telling the public that it \u2019 s being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may appear to be a slick soundbite , it hardly reflects the reality of the situation since early March .\n\u201c The UK Government keeps saying it is using the best science \u2026 But it appears to be losing sight of what \u2019 s actually going on .\nWe \u2019 ve been getting scientific advice that is consistently wrong , \u201d said Heneghan .\n\u201c It has failed to look at all the data and understand when the peak of infections actually occurred.\n\u201d \u201c Fifty per cent reductions in infections occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing and social distancing was introduced.\n\u201d \u201c If you go look at what \u2019 s happening in Sweden , they are holding their nerve and they haven \u2019 t had doomsday scenario .\nOur Government has got it completely the wrong way around.\n\u201d Sweden has been under fire in media and on social media by pro-lockdown activists who are insisting that Sweden is somehow \u2018 risking millions of lives \u2019 by opting not to implement experiment universal quarantine policies .\nRather than cave to media pressure and the advice of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of its schools open , as well as its shopping , pubs , restaurants and public spaces .\nThe government has also elected to advise rather than to enforce social distancing and common sense mitigation measures .\nAccording one of Sweden \u2019 s leading epidemiologists , Professor Johan Giesecke , Sweden is close to achieving natural herd immunity .\nSEE ALSO : Sweden vs COVID-19 : Why \u2018 Herd Immunity \u2019 Matters and Why Lockdown Doesn \u2019 t Work Professor Heneghan also criticised the UK government for its over-reliance on draconian \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , which now risks serious damage the country \u2019 s economy \u2013 panic-driven policy which could end up causing more casualties and suffering than COVID-19 itself : \u201c Look at our partners [ in the EU ] .\nThey \u2019 re opening up again .\nWe should be reopening society .\nWe need to get a plan in place rapidly , we can \u2019 t wait three weeks then slowly open up.\n\u201d \u201c As well as major economic issues , austerity will impact people \u2019 s physical and mental health.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it \u2019 s making the public scared to engage with healthcare.\n\u201d \u201c People are avoiding going to GPs and hospitals because they believe there is so much infection there that they might catch it [ coronavirus ] .\nThat \u2019 s really damaging.\n\u201d Heneghan \u2019 s study also adds addition credence to the independent analysis by Andrew Mather found here .\nMather \u2019 s work was derived solely from publicly available data from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .\nHe remarked back on April 4th : \u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government had access to clear data demonstrating that long before the declaration of UK lockdown and even at the time of the Prime Minister \u2019 s March 3rd broadcast , the data showed that Italy , Germany , Sweden and the UK were all decelerating , leveling off , and then falling away in terms of the rate of growth of the contagion .\nThe crisis was over though the contagion would continue until exhausted .\nIt is as inevitable as a ball thrown into the air , slowing down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite all available data , the UK and other western governments , forged ahead and voluntarily imploded their economies and societies , as well as suspended democracy and basic rights of citizens .\nAcross the western block , this has led to tens of millions of unemployed and hundreds of thousands of businesses destroyed as a result of the central government decrees .\nExperts are also warning about the long-term health and societal impact and immeasurable number of avoidable deaths resulting from these government decisions , a legacy

Not So Fast\u2026", "content": "More often than not , politicians will tell people what they want to hear , rather than what \u2019 s really true .\nTheir oracle of choice for such messsaging is the mainstream media , who have been aggressively pushing the claim that a miracle vaccine for the coronavirus will be arriving \u201c in a few months.\n\u201d Are such claims really true , or are they hype ?\nThis is an important question to ask , especially as the promise of a new vaccine seems to be the centerpiece of most western governments \u2019 strategies to \u2018 re-open \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 lockdown \u2019 measures designed to supposedly contain the spread of COVID-19 .\nThe Guardian claims that human trials for a Covid-19 vaccine could be completed as early as mid-August .\nHowever , when pressed on the details , UK officials are reticent to promise anything specific .\nJohn Bell from the government \u2019 s coronavirus vaccine taskforce admitted as much in a recent BBC interview : When asked recently , the UK government \u2019 s chief science advisor , Sir Patrick Vallance also reiterated that finding a coronavirus vaccine which actually works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c This is a new disease that didn \u2019 t exist before December and we have a lot to learn about the virus and how the body responds to it , \u201d said Vallance in The Guardian .\n\u201c All new vaccines that come into development are long shots ; only some end up being successful , and the whole process requires experimentation.\n\u201d \u201c Coronavirus will be no different and presents new challenges for vaccine development .\nThis will take time , and we should be clear it is not a certainty.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials in the UK , US and Canada seem to be using the vaccine as the cornerstone of their policy remedy to experimental \u2018 lockdown \u2019 measures imposed in March and April .\nHow long can they keep their mostly healthy citizens under house arrest before social unrest and disenchantment reaches unsustainable levels for government to retain power and control ?\nCurrently there are some 100 different vaccine projects underway in the \u2018 Great Corona Race \u2019 to see which one will be crowned the winner in the global panaceas sweepstakes .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even inspirational to some , the reality is much more complex and even more problematic than anyone will care to admit , especially those who are bought and paid for by the transnational corporate pharmaceutical industry which stands to make hundreds of billions in profit should any COVID-19 vaccine ever be adopted for wide scale use .\nSpeaking to STAT , Mark Feinberg , president and CEO of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative , whose work as chief public health and science officer at Merck Vaccines was instrumental in the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : More skepticism was recently aired by an envoy from the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , warning that there is no certainty over whether there will be a successful vaccine .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t necessarily develop a vaccine that is safe and effective against every virus , \u201d said David Nabarro , professor of global health at Imperial College London .\n\u201c Some viruses are very , very difficult when it comes to vaccine development , \u201d he said to The Observer .\n\u201c So for the foreseeable future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat.\n\u201d Among the leading high profile skeptics is one eminent Australian vaccine inventor who says COVID-19 may never have a preventive vaccine , but could possibly burn out .\nThe co-inventor of the controversial HPV vaccine , Professor Ian Frazer , admits that a workable vaccine for the coronavirus is \u201c tricky \u201d and may not even be possible .\nHe is instead working on an anti-viral treatment for the most vulnerable who get sick .\nFrazer says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were testing vaccines , medical scientists still do not have an effective model of how to attack this virus .\nInterestingly , Frazer stated that for 99 % of people who catch it , COVID-19 is a \u201c trivial illness.\n\u201d The professor of medicine at Queensland University , which is testing for its own COVID-19 vaccine , said immunisation against coronavirus was similar to immunising against the common cold .\n\u201c It is tricky , vaccines for upper respiratory tract diseases , because the virus lands on the outside of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us as a football , with the skin and respiratory tract on the outside of the football and the lungs are where the outside interfaces with the inside.\n\u201d \u201c The place where the virus lands is outside us and it tries to infect the cells within us.\n\u201d \u201c Our immune system is inside of us .\nWhen it lands inside our lungs it tries to infect our cells and succeeds .\nOur immune system goes to fight the virus and that \u2019 s why people get sick .\n\u201c If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can cause damage to the lungs \u2026 .\nThe wrong vaccine could make things worse so we have to be very selective about what part of the virus we want to attack.\n\u201d \u201c If you immunise someone with a vaccine , it goes inside and makes an immune response within you \u2026 .\nWhat you want is an immune response to migrate out to where the virus lands.\n\u201d \u201c There is no vaccine against the common cold.\n\u201d Prof Frazer said that with flu , the immune response inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur until the flu virus gets inside them .\n\u201c We tried to deliver a vaccine to the lungs with the Flu Mist which you snuffed up your nose , delivering the vaccine to the place where you need an immune response , but it didn \u2019 t work terribly well , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Coronavirus doesn \u2019 t get into you , it stays on the surface cells in your lungs .\nAll these flu viruses get into you , so the body can fight and makes T cells.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cells , it makes them sick .\nAt the moment we don \u2019 t know how to make a coronavirus vaccine work.\n\u201d \u201c That \u2019 s why there are 100 vaccines under testing using every conceivable approach \u2026.We don \u2019 t know if any of them will work.\n\u201d Prof Frazer said a vaccine for the 2003 SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) outbreak was never successfully developed and then the virus burnt out .\nSARS broke out in China and didn \u2019 t spread as far , partly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as great 17 years ago as it is today .\nBut , Prof Frazer said , it also had diluted potency as it went from host to host .\n\u201c As it passed from animal to the first human and then through the second human , as it passed through every human it got a little less good at infecting people , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The virus attenuated itself ; it got less powerful \u2026 .\nIt may well be the same with this virus .\nIt \u2019 s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may become less effective.\n\u201d \u201c We are now mapping it as it goes and changes are occurring in its genetic make-up , small changes.\n\u201d \u201c Changes to it in China led to the virus becoming less virulent or sick-making \u2026 .\nAt the moment it \u2019 s not passing through a lot of people in Australia.\n\u201d Prof Frazer said coronavirus was less infectious and not as deadly as MERS , the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome or camel flu which broke out in South Korea in 2015 .\n\u201c MERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people sick , \u201d he said .\n\u201c One person who went to South Korea from the Middle East infected 170 people and a third of those died \u2026 .\nHe went through four hospitals before he was diagnosed , but in South Korea they were very effective with contact tracing.\n\u201d \u201c MERS is much nastier .\u2026 than coronavirus.\n\u201d Prof Frazer explained the annual vaccines prepared against the winter flu by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories ( CSL ) were not entirely effective .\nEach year CSL \u201c takes about a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the vaccine , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We purify the protein parts of the virus out of the eggs and make the vaccine out of that .\n\u201c But it \u2019 s not 100 per cent effective at all \u2026 for older people ( because ) as your immune system gets weaker as you get older .\n\u201c With measles you are protected against it for life .\nThe vaccine kills any virus that gets into your blood .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t have a mode that works against other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently developing vaccines for cancer , is working with a team of medical scientists on a trial for a coronavirus treatment drug .\nThe intervention drug \u2019 s purpose is to dampen down the inflammatory response in high-risk coronavirus patients .\nHe said for 99 per cent of people who got coronavirus it was a trivial illness , but that was not the case for those in the vulnerable categories .\nSee the full interview at News.com Australia *** Still , there are powerful forces at play who are determined to rush what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-year process of vaccine research and development \u2013 and somehow squeeze all of that into an even highly unrealistic and potentially risky 6 to 18 months .\nThe UK government \u2019 s John Bell seems to be one of those promising a world record in deploying this new coronavirus \u2018 solution \u2019 : \u201c If we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May , then I think the game is on , \u201d he said , adding that the next step would then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture at scale many billions of doses \u201d .\nBy rushing the process , western officials and their pharmaceutical \u2018 partners \u2019 are effectively skipping animal testing and moving straight on to using humans as their guinea pigs .\n\u201c Outbreaks and national emergencies often create pressure to suspend rights , standards and/or normal rules of ethical conduct .\nOften our decision to do so seems unwise in retrospect , \u201d wrote Jonathan Kimmelman , director of McGill University \u2019 s biomedical ethics unit , for STAT .\nCould such a hasty move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessarily ?\nShould the general public be concerned that by releasing these humans out into the public then some people might also be more at risk to serious infection should they have a bad autoimmune reaction to an untested experimental vaccine ?\nAs it turns out , there are numerous problems already with the seasonal flu shot , and it only stands to reason that a vaccine for the common cold variant of the coronavirus will experience related problems of \u201c negative vaccine effectiveness \u201d , or the increase in risk of illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses .\nLike any vaccine expected to cover for multiple variants of the coronavirus , we have learned from the Flu shot that this may not actually be possible .\nCriticisms and failures of the annual Flu shot can be found here , here and here .\nSuch a rushed strategy by the world \u2019 s governments may pose additional problems in terms of risk to public health , but so far governments do not seem to mind in this case because supposedly \u2018 the threat is too great to wait and follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far from being the \u2018 sure thing \u2019 which people like Bill Gates , GAVI , and other health experts are claiming it to be , the idea that a working vaccine which the industry has never been able to manage in history , can all of the sudden be conjured up in a mater of months \u2013 could easily end up introducing more new problems into this situation in addition to the ones we have already .\nAll indications are that any rush to fast-track a vaccine for COVID-19 could end badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hyping this possibility .\nThe real question is : do they really have the public \u2019 s best interests in mind , or are there other more powerful ( and profitable ) overriding agendas at play here ?\nLET US KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS BELOW\u2026", "author": "21wire", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2020/04/21/a-vaccine-by-september-not-so-fast/",

the Discovery of the Virus", "content": "Is it possible that the entire coronavirus narrative is a house of cards ?\n21WIRE has already been asking questions concerning flawed statistics such as case fatality ratios , irregularities in how deaths are recorded , and the dubious wisdom of lockdown measures .\nWe have also been covering the growing chorus of experts suggesting that COVID-19 may not be as deadly as feared .\nHowever , factors such as the number of COVID deaths and whether lockdowns work are totally dependent on other , more fundamental questions : How accurate are the tests being used ?\nWhat do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven that this virus causes this disease ?\nIt may yet emerge that the very foundations of the MSM/government narrative \u2014 that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causes a disease called COVID-19 , and that tests for the virus will tell if you \u2019 re sick or not \u2014 have yet to be proven .\nConsider all that has happened since the beginning of this crisis : projections of millions dead , entire countries quarantined , unprecedented economic carnage , civil liberties tossed aside , the public in fear .\nWe are told there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation lies in contact tracing ( total surveillance ) , biometric immunity passports , and experimental vaccines currently being developed in great haste .\nThe total cost of this crisis will be at the very least tens of trillions of dollars , but the actual amount is in fact incalculable , and much of what will be lost can not be measured in dollars anyway .\nConsidering such a price tag , would it not be a good idea to prove the virus to be the cause of the disease first ?\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a number of gaping holes in it , and a few voices are questioning the underlying assumptions upon which the entire coronavirus crisis is based .\nThe following article by Jon Rappoport looks at a scientific paper by researcher David Crowe that does just that .\nOur political leaders say they are \u201c guided by the science \u201d , but talk is cheap .\nUntil these fundamental questions are answered , whatever those leaders are doing is not based on sound science .\nMore on this from Jon Rappoport\u2026 Canadian author and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent several decades analyzing and torpedoing SPECIFICS of conventional medical research .\nAt the deepest level .\nI \u2019 m talking about , for example , the mainstream claims of discovering new viruses .\nCrowe doesn \u2019 t lay on vague brushstrokes .\nHe goes to the core of fabrications and exposes them , chapter and verse .\nHis new paper , which he continues to update and expand , is : \u201c Flaws in Coronavirus Pandemic Theory \u201d .\nHere I quote from the section of his paper where he takes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new virus which they assert is the cause of a new pandemic , COVID-19 ?\nAt the end of this article , I list the published papers Crowe refers to by number , as he takes apart the very basis of the COVID illusion .\nDavid Crowe : \u201c Scientists are detecting novel RNA in multiple patients with pneumonia-like conditions , and are assuming that the detection of RNA ( which is believed to be wrapped in proteins to form an RNA virus , as coronaviruses are believed to be ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not , and one of the groups of scientists was honest enough to admit this \u201d : \u201c \u2019 we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood \u2019 \u201d [ 2 ] \u201c But , despite this admission , earlier in the paper they repeatedly referred to the 41 cases ( out of 59 similar cases ) that tested positive for this RNA as , \u2018 41 patients\u2026confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV \u2019 .\n\u201d \u201c Koch \u2019 s postulates , first stated by the great German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can simply be stated as \u201d : \u201c * Purify the pathogen ( e.g .\nvirus ) from many cases with a particular illness .\n* Expose susceptible animals ( obviously not humans ) to the pathogen .\n* Verify that the same illness is produced .\n* Some add that you should also re-purify the pathogen , just to be sure that it really is creating the illness.\n\u201d \u201c Famous virologist Thomas Rivers stated in a 1936 speech , \u2018 It is obvious that Koch \u2019 s postulates have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was a long time ago , but the same problem still continues .\nNone of the papers referenced in this article have even attempted to purify the virus .\nAnd the word \u2018 isolation \u2019 has been so debased by virologists it means nothing ( e.g .\nadding impure materials to a cell culture and seeing cell death is \u2018 isolation \u2019 ) .\n\u201d \u201c Reference [ 1 ] did publish electron [ microscope ] micrographs , but it can clearly be seen in the lesser magnified photo , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purified as the quantity of material that is cellular is much greater .\nThe paper notes that the photos are from \u2018 human airway epithelial cells \u2019 .\nAlso consider that the photo included in the article will certainly be the \u2018 best \u2019 photo , i.e .\nthe one with the greatest number of particles .\nLab technicians may be encouraged to spend hours to look around to find the most photogenic image , the one that most looks like pure virus.\n\u201d \u201c There is no way to tell that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCR test is found in those particles seen under the electron micrograph .\nThere is no connection between the test , and the particles , and no proof that the particles are viral.\n\u201d \u201c A similar situation was revealed in March 1997 concerning HIV , when two papers published in the same issue of the journal \u2018 Virology \u2019 revealed that the vast majority of what had previously been called \u2018 pure HIV \u2019 was impurities that were clearly not HIV , and the mixture also included microvesicles that look very similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are of cellular origin.\n\u201d [ 5 ] [ 6 ] 1 .\nZhu N et al

.\nBenevolentAI , a company that uses AI to discover and develop generic medicines , \u2018 rediscovered \u2019 Baricitinib , a drug used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis .\nBenevolentAI predicts Baricitinib will inhibit the Covid\u201319 infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBenevolentAI says that Baricitinib should not be seen as a \u2018 cure \u2019 , owing to the fact that 80 % of people suffering from the virus will recover without any intervention , but that the drug will be used to treat those that present the worst symptoms .\nBaricitinib was approved by the EU for use as a drug to treat Arthritis in February 2017 at a dose of 4 mg .\nIn the US , however , the Food and Drug Administration delayed its approval by several months while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The FDA eventually approved Baricitnib at a 2 mg dose , refusing the 4 mg dose due to adverse side effects .\nBaricitinib was put forward by BenevolentAI as a possible treatment for Covid\u201319 in February 2020 .\nBy early March , investigator-led studies began recruiting and treating infected patients .\nWho is behind BenevolentAI ?\nIn two words : Bill Gates .\nLet \u2019 s see how : BenevolentAI receives millions of pounds worth of funding from Upsher-Smith , a US pharmaceutical company .\nUpsher-Smith \u2019 s Chief Information Officer is Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Gates Foundation for more than ten years .\nKnowlton is responsible for Upsher-Smith \u2019 s long term strategy as well as their \u2018 go-to-market \u2019 strategy , which determines how they will reach customer targets and achieve a competitive advantage .\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation bought 500,000 Goldman Sachs shares in 2010 .\nGoldman Sachs funds BenevolentAI .\nTemasek Holdings , a Singaporean investment company , has substantial investments with Benevolent AI , as well as a joint interest with the Gates Foundation with another global tech-based company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help rid the world of infectious disease and to whom GlaxoSmithKline , a company heavily linked to the Gates Foundation , recently pledged some $ 250 million dollars in order to help find a Covid\u201319 vaccine .\nWoodford Investment Management , owned by disgraced British-born investor Neil Woodford , was another investor in BenevolentAI until its collapse in October 2019 .\nIn 2015 Neil Woodford and the Gates Foundation joined forces by investing $ 90 m\u200b\u200b\u200billion in biopharmaceutical company Kymab .\nFinally , by coincidence , Baricitinib is produced by Eli Lilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we shall see in a moment , Bill Gates has considerable interests .\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation lists approximately 69 different organisations that receive money from their organisation , 46 of which are health care based organisations , of which there are 30 that specialise in the production , manufacturing or distribution of drugs and vaccines .\nBill Gates stood down from his role as CEO to Microsoft in 2000 .\nIn 2002 he sold approximately 1.3 % of his holdings in Microsoft , generating somewhere in the region of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this capital to invest in the pharmaceutical industry , most notably Merck , Pfizer and Eli Lilly , the company that is currently trialing Baricitinib for Covid-19 .\nEli Lilly , GlaxoSmithKline , Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer all donate millions of dollars , along with the Gates foundation , to the \u2018 Dementia Discovery Fund \u2019 .\nThe same companies have aligned to expand healthcare access to 1.7 million people across Africa , pledging between them $ 18 million to two NGOs : Living Good and Last Mile Health .\nGlaxoSmithKline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also partners with Immunicore , a leading T-cell receptor biotechnology company .\nThe Gates Foundation also gives millions of pounds to Elanco , an animal health division of Eli Lilly .\nThe Covid\u201319 pandemic will see the relationship between these companies get even tighter .\nThe recent announcement that \u2018 Life Sciences companies \u2019 will commit their expertise in a bid to fight the current pandemic will see fifteen pharmaceutical companies share data with the \u2018 Covid\u201319 Therapeutic Accelerator \u2019 , which was launched by the Gates Foundation , Wellcome and Mastercard several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the usual suspects : Eli Lilly , GlaxoSmithKline , Johnson & Johnson , Merck , and Pfizer .\nIn early March , Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks had told CNBC that his company is hoping to start testing a \u2018 cure \u2019 for Covid\u201319 in the summer , and had teamed up with AbCellera , a company that had , back in March 2018 , been granted a contract by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) to develop rapid countermeasures against viral outbreaks in order to develop \u2018 field-ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation of a viral pathogen .\nThe Gates Foundation , as well as Eli Lilly , has given substantial amounts of money to German-based pharmaceutical CureVac , a company considered as a pioneer for the development of vaccines \u2014 the former also granting money to two more programmes , one of which was for a novel flu vaccine in 2018 ( the same year AbCellera was working with DARPA on a pandemic response ) .\nThe Gates Foundation had already given $ 46 Million to CureVac in 2015 to develop a new facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccine Technology \u201d .\nThe Gates Foundation also invests heavily in health surveillance , investing $ 105 million to set up the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , which evaluates strategies used to tackle healthcare and provides information and advice to policymakers .\nIt funds \u2018 Access to Medicine \u2019 , which ranks twenty of the world \u2019 s largest research based pharmaceutical companies and cites itself as a \u2018 tool for driving change in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u2019 Such measures certainly put pressure on an industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which reputation is paramount .\nThe opinions of such institutions as these created by the Gates Foundation have the power to drive and steer professionals in one particular way or another .\nSuch large grants have undoubtedly given the Gates Foundation unprecedented influence , but they have not come without criticism .\nOne study showed that , of the $ 9 billion for 1094 global health grants between 1998 and 2007 , a third was given to the research and development of vaccines and microbicides .\nAccording to the chief malaria officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created a situation where it is difficult to find independent peer review , as researchers are afraid to criticise each other in fear that they will not get a much-needed grant from the Gates Foundation .\nOthers in the field have commented that this sort of behaviour constrains research , forces undemocratic decisions and ultimately forces people to engage in the grantors \u2019 agenda , in this case that of the Gates Foundation .\nAs an author of an investigation about the Gates Foundation \u2019 s priorities and decision-making process concluded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor with a huge degree of influence , but not really a mechanism by which that influence is held to public account.\n\u201d Either way , as lockdown continues to hamper the lives of millions of people , and destroy thousands upon thousands of businesses , we are continually told that lockdown is here to stay until we have a vaccine \u2014 undoubtedly under the advice of the healthcare- and pharmaceutical-led professionals who in some way shape or form fall within reach of the Gates Foundation .\nWhichever of the large pharmaceutical corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates Foundation stands to make a solid financial return on its investment .\nIt is unlikely that any one company will have the ability , let alone the resources , to produce vaccinations for seven billion people , as Gates is suggesting .\nAll the better to form a consortium and pool resources .\n*** Author Malcolm Massey is an independent researcher and filmmaker with media organisation UK Column .", "author": "21wire", "url":

Crisis That is COVID-19", "content": "By all accounts and from the very beginning it was clear to some that Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( Covid-19 ) was at the very most a little more dangerous than the seasonal flu \u2013 but was being deliberately hyped to stampede the public into an increasingly tangled web of bad policies .\nAs early as last month , cooler-headed experts had warned that hyped death rates spread by politicians , the Western corporate media , other various panic-mongers , and even World Health Organization ( WHO ) officials would give way to much , much lower death rates as more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had the virus , most of whom showed little to no symptoms .\nThe numbers of infections versus deaths in Iceland ( where no \u2018 lockdown \u2019 took place ) where testing has been the most widespread shows a death rate of about 0.5 % , though only 5 % of the population has been tested .\nRoughly 50 % of those tested showed no symptoms at all \u2013 meaning that many , many more Icelanders likely had the virus , overcame it with ease without ever visiting a doctor or hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make into national Covid-19 statistics .\nSenate leader Mitch McConnell stages yet another bizarre \u2018 social distancing \u2019 press event on Capitol Hill .\nAnother study conducted in the United States by Stanford University found that the infection rate was likely 50 to 85 times higher than reported \u2013 meaning the death rate was astronomically lower than previously reported , and really sat at around 0.2 % to as low as 0.12 % \u2013 certainly nothing near the 3-4 % claimed by the World Health Organization .\nIn other words : in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dangerous or deadly than the annual flu .\nBut it has been hyped as such by Western politicians , the Western corporate media , and even international institutions like WHO \u2013 a deliberate deception accompanied by coordinated theater including government briefings with reporters comically spaced out in \u201c fear \u201d of contracting Covid-19 .\nOther props used to panic the public into imprisoning themselves at home and accepting the immense socioeconomic damage \u201c lockdowns \u201d are causing included showing misleading exponential graphs of infections seemingly rising straight up with no end in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphs in context \u2013 say , perhaps next to annual flu infection curves \u2013 the public would notice they are virtually identical and simply represent the way the flu , colds , and Covid-19 which is related to both \u2013 work their way through populations .\nThe same goes for total deaths .\nShould the media present Covid-19 deaths in the context of and in comparison to annual deaths from the flu , Americans \u2013 for example \u2013 would see that versus the 2019 flu season , Covid-19 is actually 30,000-40,000 deaths short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying nothing of living up to the hype and hysteria that the government and media have deliberately created around Covid-19 to justify its \u2018 lockdown \u2019 policies .\nSo why have governments around the globe crippled their economies , put millions out of work , and placed draconian measures in place to , in essence , imprison their populations at home ?\nThose with power and money seek to keep what they have and to take what little is left in the hands of others .\nDuring the manufactured \u201c War on Terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across society to justify draconian police powers at home and endless wars abroad \u2013 pouring ultimately trillions into the accounts of defense contractors and the financial institutions invested in them .\nDuring a manufactured health crisis like the 2009 H1N1 \u201c Swine Flu \u201d outbreak , the unfounded fear of an uncontrollable pathogen ravaging the population helped justify the centralizing of control over people \u2019 s health and lifestyle while pumping billions in pubic funding into the coffers of Big Pharma .\nAnd here we are again with the very same interests who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , doing it again , but on a much larger and more destructive scale and creating socioeconomic havoc virtually no one will escape completely .\nIf the Covid-19 hoax ( indeed , there are so many aspects of this which are by definition a hoax ) doesn \u2019 t convince you to divest from the politicians and the corporations they serve \u2013 including divesting from big-business \u2019 goods and services \u2013 nothing will .\nSpecial interests have just beta-tested turning entire nations into virtual prisons .\nIf people allow it this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to

Carter , head of the British Armed Forces , at Downing Street COVID-19 briefing .\nLast Wednesday , during the daily UK Government Coronavirus livestream , the head of the British Army , General Sir Nick Carter , bragged : To understand the implications of this statement , we have to go back to 2018 , when Carter gave a speech to the Royal United Services Institute .\n\u201c In our 77th Brigade , \u201d he said , \u201c \u2026 we have got some remarkable talent when it comes to social media , production design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of skills we can \u2019 t afford to retain in the Regular component but they are the means of us delivering capability in a much more imaginative way than we might have been able to do in the past.\n\u201d Previously known as the \u2018 Security Assistance Group \u2019 , 77th Brigade was stood up in 2015 as part of \u2018 Army 2020 \u2019 .\nThe Security Assistance Group had been established following the amalgamation of the Media Operations Group , 15 Psychological Operations Group , Security Capacity Building Team , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77th Brigade is described on their website as being about \u2018 information and outreach \u2019 .\nBut what does that mean ?\nGeneral Carter again : It is in this context , then , that Carter \u2019 s words from last week \u2019 s livestream should be viewed .\nCarter has acknowledged that the British military is waging war on a section of its own population .\nCarter mentioned working with the Cabinet Office \u2019 s \u2018 Rapid Response Unit \u2019 .\nEstablished in April 2018 and also known as the \u2018 fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unit was given an initial six months \u2019 funding .\nIt brought together a \u201c team of analysts , data scientists and media and digital experts , \u201d armed with cutting-edge software , to \u201c work round the clock to monitor online breaking news stories and social media discussion.\n\u201d According to the RRU \u2019 s head , Alex Aiken : The unit \u2019 s round the clock monitoring service has identified several stories of concern during the pilot , ranging from the chemical weapons attack in Syria to domestic stories relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following the Syria airstrikes , the unit identified that a number of false narratives from alternative news sources were gaining traction online .\nThese \u201c alt-news \u201d sources are biased and rely on sensationalism rather than facts to pique readers \u2019 interest .\nDue to the way that search engine algorithms work , when people searched for information on the strikes , these unreliable sources were appearing above official UK government information .\nIn fact , no government information was appearing on the first 15 pages of Google results .\nWe know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention .\nIt can reflect bias in information received from elsewhere .\nThe unit therefore ensured those using search terms that indicated bias \u2013 such as \u2018 false flag \u2019 \u2013 were presented with factual information on the UK \u2019 s response .\nThe RRU improved the ranking from below 200 to number 1 within a matter of hours .\nThe Rapid Response Unit was given permanent funding in February 2019 .\nThree months following the establishment of the Rapid Response Unit , Theresa May attended the G7 summit in Quebec , Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c a new Rapid Response Mechanism \u201c , following Britain \u2019 s proposal for \u201c a new , more formalised approach to tackling foreign interference across the G7 \u201d at the G7 Foreign Minister \u2019 s meeting the previous month .\nThe agreement sends \u201c a strong message that interference by Russia and other foreign states would not be tolerated , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The Rapid Response Mechanism , \u201d she continued , \u201c will support preventative and protective cooperation between G7 countries , as well as post-incident responses \u201d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapid Response , then , is to create international agreement on a common narrative ( via the \u2018 mechanism \u2019 ) , and then wage an information war on its own people to make sure that narrative is protected in the media ( via the \u2018 unit \u2019 ) .\nDuring Carter \u2019 s 2018 RUSI speech , he explained the role of the mainstream press in \u201c setting up a well-informed public debate \u201d .\nHe spoke about \u201c political warfare \u201d being war by other means , and he said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion \u201d approach .\nHere , he is referring to the Fusion Doctrine , which was launched during the Theresa May regime , as part of the 2015 National Security Capability Review .\n\u201c Many capabilities , \u201d it said , \u201c that can contribute to national security lie outside traditional national security departments and so we need stronger partnerships across government and with the private and third sectors.\n\u201d It should come as no surprise , then , that the Cabinet Office \u2019 s Rapid Response Unit is not only working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is \u201c leading on the \u2018 rebuttal of false narratives \u2019 as part of the unit \u2026 [ that also ] involves the Home Office , DCMS , Number 10 and other agencies.\n\u201d General Carter said his 77th Brigade is \u201c helping to quash rumours from misinformation , but also to counter disinformation.\n\u201d What misinformation and disinformation is 77th Brigade helping to quash ?\nHow much of the \u2018 disinformation \u2019 originates from 77th Brigade in the first place ?\nThey not only \u2018 counter \u2019 disinformation , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including their own , spreads ; mapping the internet and the networks of people sharing content between each other .\nAnd for that , they have thousands deployed , and tens of thousands in reserve , not only in 77th Brigade directly , but right across government and the third sector .\n*** Author Mike Robinson is news presenter and editor at

, intensive care hospitals , in readiness for a predicted epidemic number of severe COVID-19 cases .\nThey are called NHS Nightingale Hospitals , and to date there are seven of them , either open or planned .\nThe first one was announced on 24 March by the Health Secretary , Matt Hancock , and was opened almost immediately on 3 April at the London Excel Centre .\nIt has a capacity of some 4,000 beds .\nThe other temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham , Glasgow , Bristol , Exeter , Harrogate , and Washington .\nAdditionally , over the last month , some 8,000 beds in private hospitals have been re-assigned for Covid-19 use , along with other NHS beds in hospitals all over the UK .\nBy the beginning of April , one third of all non-ICU NHS beds had been converted into potential ICU beds for possible Covid-19 patients .\nYet , by 12 April , the London Nightingale had treated just 19 patients , and to date , only 41 patients have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both unusual and unprecedented .\nWe regularly have seasonal infectious illnesses spread throughout the population ; in fact in recent years , some of these epidemic diseases were also predicted well in advance .\nYet no new mega-hospitals , temporary or otherwise , were ever built to cope with them , nor were they seen to be needed .\nWhy now ?\nAccording to the King \u2019 s Fund , over the last thirty years , the number of ICU beds has declined , at a time when the population has risen .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general and critical care beds in England have been lost .\nPeter Donaghy , an independent data analyst , reports that the UK now comes near the bottom of the world league in the number of hospital beds per head of population : in 2019 , and across the four UK nations , he found that there are about 5.7 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population [ interpolation of his figures mine ] .\nCyprus has double that number , Germany has 29 , the USA 34 , and even Kazakhstan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBed shortages are not news , however .\nIn 2008 , it was revealed that 32,000 beds of all types had been cut in the decade since 1997 , when , ironically , the Blair government came into power on a ticket of increasing the number of hospital beds .\nBetween 2010 and 2017 there were 70,000 fewer intensive care beds in the UK : In 2016 , the Royal College of Surgeons had complained of chronic bed shortages , so much so that the occupancy rates had gone beyond 89 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum safe level .\nThis complaint was made just before the British Medical Association chimed in , reporting on the shortage of beds being more severe than in other Western countries , and that such overcrowding can lead to the spread of infections .\nAnd in 2018 , the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine ( FICM ) astonishingly reported that across the UK , 80 % of intensive care units were sending patients to other hospitals , either because of a lack of beds or a shortage of staff , particularly nurses .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was being reported by the British Medical Association that ICU beds had begun to be used for patients recovering from routine operations , and that when more emergency beds were needed , a policy of \u201c escalation beds \u201d came into force .\nThe BMA drily reported that there was \u201c little sign of this practice ending \u201d .\nWhen one thinks of the NHS , intensive care is at the heart of most people \u2019 s perceptions of it .\nYet the decline in the number of ICU beds over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it \u2019 s as if some monster deus ex machina has intervened and decided not only that the general numbers of hospital beds are of little import , but that intensive care beds are even more expendable .\nBut whatever the case , in the event of a mass epidemic , the consequences of ICU bed shortages were indeed grim prior to 2020 .\nWhat official policies have the post-Blair governments been maintaining throughout this decline in the number of ICU beds ?\nTo get a general feel , looking back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper , outlining what the official response to a hypothetical pandemic should be .\nThis paper appears to have been written largely in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak .\nIts precautionary approach stresses that actions following the emergence of a pandemic , which could occur suddenly at any time : \u2022 be proportional to the level of threat \u2022 emergency powers must last no longer than 30 days Significantly , it states that during any pandemic , it should be \u201c business as usual \u201d and notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earlier , 2007 , National Framework paper \u2019 s \u201c defence in depth \u201d approach to a pandemic .\nThe Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper also makes clear that military personnel are not to be redeployed during a pandemic , but must remain on their normal defence duties .\nSo of course , this means that they were not to be used to help build vast temporary hospitals , transport patients , or manage the public .\nIn fact , the paper is silent on any hospital bed policies ; it takes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK ICU beds for the treatment of pandemic disease patients \u2013 for in 2009 \u2019 s H1N1 swine flu outbreak , generally , hospitals may have just coped with finding enough beds for acute H1N1 patients .\nThere were 540,000 cases of swine flu in England , and 138 fatalities at the time , or 0.026 % of those infected .\nFollowing the publication of the 2011 preparedness paper , however , the number of ICU beds continued to fall .\nThen , five years later , government held an unusual and secretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all government departments , all local authorities , and the NHS , right across the UK .\nIts report has not been published for \u201c national security reasons \u201d and so as not to \u201c frighten the public \u201d .\nHowever , according to those with first-hand knowledge of the operation , Cygnus \u2019 script contained a scenario of a patent lack of capacity in ICU beds and personal protective equipment .\nBased on its given hypotheses , it predicted that thousands more critical care beds would be required , large parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to redeploy staff , frail patients would be denied care , and mortuaries would be overwhelmed .\nWas this just an experiment to see how the public sector actors involved would react to each other , like some kind of Grand Guignol ?\nDid the exercise take its inspiration from the memorably twisted 2012 London Olympics ceremony , in which rows of thousands of NHS patients in hospital beds , in a dark auditorium looking like a Nightingale Hospital , were danced around by strange beasts and actors wearing scrubs ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , London , under the aegis of Neil Ferguson , who is also now doing the modelling of Covid-19 .\nTellingly , it is said that last month \u2019 s Coronavirus Act , the emergency legislation which underpins the lockdown , is based on his modelling in Exercise Cygnus .\nFerguson \u2019 s involvement in the Coronavirus crisis does raise other questions \u2013 for further coverage see Vanessa Beeley \u2019 s article : Who controls the British Government response to Covid\u201319 ?\nOutside of the strange artificial world of Exercise Cygnus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of Surgeons continued to complain about bed shortages .\nSo why was there no turnaround policy introduced at least by 2016 after these professional outcries ?\nThe Health Secretary at the time was Jeremy Hunt .\nSimon Stevens was Chief of NHS England .\nBoth had been involved in cutting bed numbers .\nYet , since 2016 , and prior to the COVID-19 outbreak , with Sir Simon Stevens still at the helm , there appears to have been no general improvement in ICU bed capacity .\nFollowing Exercise Cygnus , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short internal paper called Emergency Preparedness , Resilience and Response ( EPRR ) .\nIts approach is centred on three Acts of Parliament : the Civil Contingencies Act ( 2004 ) , the NHS Act ( 2006 ) , and the Health and Social Care Act ( 2012 ) .\nDrawn up by Director of Operations and Information for the NHS Board , Matthew Swindells ( sic ) , it asks the Board to agree that progress had been made in EPRR over the last year , and that the NHS was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rubber stamped , but as we have seen above , the somewhat rosy , self-congratulatory picture that was approved by the NHS Board was shown to be completely incorrect by Statista in 2017 , and later , by the Faculty of Intensive Care in 2018 , the BMA in 2019 , and Peter Donaghy in 2020 .\nBack to Exercise Cygnus .\nThis was supposed to be merely a computer simulation .\nSo why would it be an issue of \u201c national security \u201d ?\nWhy would it \u201c frighten the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the real world into its simulated image ?\nIt \u2019 s an uncanny coincidence that , after the Coronavirus pandemic was declared , it was announced that there were not enough ICU beds or personal protective equipment , that NHS staff have been redeployed to other areas , that hospitalised elderly patients have been denied care through the use of \u201c Do Not Resuscitate \u201d orders , and large , temporary , mortuaries have also been built up and down the country , just as in the simulation .\nSince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been non-stop media coverage propagandising the numbers of cases and deaths , and its threat .\nAll the while , there have been regular reports that many ICU beds are empty , that beds of other sorts are empty , and that although accident and emergency visits are down , people with serious conditions telephoning the NHS advice and triage number , are being told to \u201c Stay at home \u2013 Save the NHS \u2013 Save Lives \u201d .\nMany of these callers have then died for lack of care .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration have been lowered by the government , and that there has been encouragement to register anyone who dies , of any underlying condition , as a Covid-19 death .\nThere need be no objective verification of the existence of Covid-19 to register a death as being caused by it .\nDespite these efforts to inflate the death rate , actual mortality rates since the beginning of this crisis do not show that we are in the middle of a pandemic , and actual critical case numbers are not overwhelming the NHS \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that regard , Covid-19 is not mirroring Exercise Cygnus \u2019 computer-generated scenario .\nThe government response , however , seems to match it exactly .", "author":

social decline as a direct result of imposing \u2018 lockdown \u2019 on their populations , other countries have taken a different approach to dealing with the coronavirus threat .\nYou wouldn \u2019 t know it by listening to western politicians or mainstream stenographers , there are the nonlockdown countries \u2013 led by Sweden , Iceland , Belarus , Japan , South Korea and Taiwan .\nSurprisingly to some , their results have been as good or better than the lockdown countries , but without having to endure the socio-economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nFor this reason alone , Sweden and others like them , have already won the socio-economic debate , as well as the scientific one too .\nUnlike much of the rest of the world who saw fit to unquestioningly follow China \u2019 s lead on everything from quarantining , to economic shutdowns , to contact tracing , and PCR mass testing , nonlockdown countries have instead opted for a much lighter touch \u2013 to preserving their economies and societies , and in doing so avoiding an endless daisy chain of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition of brutal lockdown policy .\nOn the European front , the Scandinavian country of Sweden is now garnering much more attention , and has become an object of both fascination and criticism for the lockdown world .\nWhile countries like the United States and Great Britain continue to top the global tables in terms of death tolls , Sweden has only suffered marginal casualties while avoiding the intense strain on society and loss in public confidence which lockdown governments are now suffering from as they continue to push their populations to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most other countries , Sweden has not enforced any strict mass quarantine measures to contain COVID-19 , nor has it closed any of its borders .\nRather , Swedish health authorities have issued reasonable guidelines for social distancing and other common sense measures covering areas like hygiene , travel , public gatherings , and protecting the elderly and immune compromised , as well as keeping all preschools , primary and secondary schools open , while closing college and universities who are doing their work in online classrooms .\nLikewise , many bars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have to perform the bizarre ritual of queuing around the block standing 2 meters apart in order to buy groceries .\nIt seems this particular Nordic model has already won the debate , as they are now well underway to achieving natural herd immunity .\nBecause Sweden decided to follow real epidemiological science and pursue a common sense strategy of herd immunity , it does need to \u201c flatten of the curve \u201d because its strategic approach has the added benefit of achieving a much more gradual and wider spread .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisor for epidemiology explains , \u201c We are all trying to keep the spread of this disease as low as possible , mainly to prevent our healthcare system from being overstretched , but we have not gone for the complete lockdown .\nWe have managed to keep the number of cases low enough so the intensive care units have kept working and there has always been 20 per cent beds empty and enough protective equipment , even in Stockholm , where there has been a huge stress on healthcare .\nSo in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it doesn \u2019 t have the deal with the newest crisis obstacle which lockdown states are now using as an excuse not to reopen society and the economy , which the fear of a \u2018 second peak \u2018 which they are telling the public will wreak havoc on the nation by \u201c infecting the vulnerable \u201d and \u201c overwhelm the health services \u201d if everything is reopened and social isolation and distancing is relaxed .\nThis catch 22 which countries like the US and UK are caught in is predicated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the coronavirus will suddenly unleash itself again on the populace .\nCertainly , there could be a second surge \u2013 but this would be directly as a result of the decision to lockdown in the first place .\nAccording to top epidemiologist Dr Knut Wikkowski , the decision to lockdown only delayed the inevitable for countries like the US and UK , and quite possibly made the COVID-19 problem worse than it would have previously been in the short to midterm , but in the long-term the results would be relatively the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe penny should have really dropped after it was revealed two weeks ago by Oxford Professor Carl Heneghan , Director for Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine , that the peak of the UK \u2019 s coronavirus \u2018 crisis \u2019 actually came a full week before Boris Johnson initiated lockdown on March 23rd .\nThe numbers don \u2019 t lie , but statistics can be made to tell any story the narrator wants , especially when the storyteller is government .\nJust look at the last 50 years of announcements regarding unemployment and inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learnd by now is that government will never let things like facts and real science get in the way of a slow motion train wreck in progress .\nAs western lockdown countries drift further and further into an economic and social purgatory , nonlockdown countries like Sweden seem to be the target of bad-natured criticism by western mainstream media .\nThis seems to out spite more than anything , as many western mainstream journalists and pundits are sensing defeat after they had thrown their lot in with lockdown policy early on , unquestioningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once again invoking the TINA ( There Is No Alternative ) principle which history shows is normally precedes most man-made calamities from World War I , to the 2008 Wall Street Bail Out , or the Iraq War in 2003 .\nNonetheless , the media and political pressure has been almost relentless on the Scandanavian country for not complying with the west \u2019 s \u2018 lockdown consensus.\n\u2019 Sweden has also been roundly criticized by some 2,300 academics who piled on scorn in a letter in March demanding the government change course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the country has held off on that , and has since been endorsed by a number of eminent academics and professions , like Professor Heneghan who hailed Sweden for \u201c holding its nerve , \u201d in the face of such public condemnation .\nThat steadfastness seems to finally be paying dividends now , as some western mainstream media outlets , and even the UN itself , have gradually begun to acknowledge their comparable success .\nThe New York Post begrudgingly acknowledged that Sweden received praise from the high chair of global public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO ) , now lauded as a \u201c model \u201d for overcoming the coronavirus crisis while other countries have opted to self-impose voluntary draconian \u2018 lockdowns \u2019 and summarily imploding their economies and causing a deluge of many millions unemployment and bankruptcies .\nDr. Mike Ryan , WHO head of emergency management said , \u201c What it has done differently is it has very much relied on its relationship with its citizenry and the ability and willingness of its citizens to implement self-distancing and self-regulate.\n\u201d \u201c In that sense , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population \u2026 .\nI think if we are to reach a new normal , Sweden represents a model if we wish to get back to a society in which we don \u2019 t have lockdowns , \u201d added Ryan .\nSo according to WHO , now Sweden is the new normal \u2013 and not the reactionary medieval quarantine policy with all of its obsessive social isolation , and collective economic suicide ?\nSuch words from WHO should , in theory , be reassuring to those stuck in their lockdown death spirals .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced of the TINA principle , even if their next door neighbor has chosen a short and more practical route through .\nMore than anything , this conundrum speaks to the relationship between people and their governments .\nIndeed , it is the social contract between government and its citizens which forms the core of the country \u2019 s policy formation .\nThe idea that the choice to lockdown is a straight trade-off between lives and economy is a false dichotomy argument which ignores many concomitant variables and factors which are at play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in terms of economy versus a health of people .\nI think it was a broader concern about the social fabric in general , \u201d said Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh , professor of history and civil society studies at Ersta Sk\u00f6ndal University College .\n\u201c It is wonderful that we have retained the amount of freedoms that we have here \u2026.Who would have thought , you know , that Swedish social democracy would be in bed with American right-wing libertarians ?\nNot me , \u201d remarked Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh .\nProfessor Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler from Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state was duty-bound to take the direction it did .\n\u201c We must establish control over the situation , we can not head into a situation where we get complete chaos .\nNo one has tried this route , so why should we test it first in Sweden , without informed consent ?\n\u201d said Soderberg-Naucler .\nThis concept of people talking responsibility for their actions and for public well-being is actually enshrined in Sweden \u2019 s constitution .\nThis means that the government does not have to threaten and abuse its citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buying \u2018 non essential items \u2019 when out shopping , or meeting in small groups .\nSwedes know the risks and observe government guidelines accordingly .\nThey also acknowledge that humans are not perfect and won \u2019 t use police and courts to punish citizens if they are not following order to the letter \u2013 as is the case in many lockdown countries .\nThis bad blood between the public and government will not evaporate after the \u2018 crisis \u2019 is over , which is a big problem lockdown governments will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Post had to include the caveat that Sweden was something of a pariah state for \u201c controversially refused restrictions \u201c .\nThe propaganda war could be seen in the paper \u2019 s subtle wordsmithing , where editors even went so far as to change their headline from \u201c WHO lauds Sweden as \u2018 model \u2019 in coronavirus fight for resisting lockdown , \u201d to a slightly more incendiary \u201c WHO lauds lockdown-ignoring Sweden as a \u2018 model \u2019 for countries going forward \u201d Swedish critics are quick to point out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Scandinavian neighbors , Denmark , Norway and Finland .\nThey do this by pointing to the new global bible of public policy \u2013 the World-o-Meter coronavirus running totals , which for some people is the end all and be all which it comes to declaring how really , really bad things are , and will continue to be ( because that meter just keeps on running ) .\nAs of today , Sweden , which a population of roughly 10.5 million , has recorded 21,092 cases and 2,586 fatalities from COVID-19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people .\nBy contrast , its southern neighbor Denmark which has a population of 5.8 million has recorded 9,1058 cases and 452 fatalities , roughly 78 deaths per million persons .\nNorway is similar population at 5.4 million , and has recorded 7,738 cases and 210 deaths , that \u2019 s 39 deaths per million .\nFinland has a population of 5.5 million confirmed just 4,995 cases and 211 deaths , with 38 deaths per million .\nCritics of Sweden have all seized upon these differences in order to condemn their government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing Russian roulette \u201d with their citizens \u2019 lives .\nIf one didn \u2019 t know better , from all the hysterical rhetoric , you \u2019 d think there was an impending genocide happening there .\nWhile this sort of polemic arguments seem to work in the narrow band of reality that are social media threads , the reality is that after scaling up its neighbors \u2019 results to be in line with Sweden \u2019 s larger population which is roughly twice their size , the difference is statistically insignificant for a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing that when comparing Sweden to its neighbor Denmark , that a proportional difference of approximately 1,500 fatalities warrants Sweden closing all its schools and shutting down its entire economy , and suffer all the chaos ill effects that goes with that course of action .\nIt \u2019 s a ridiculous argument on its face , and yet , this is the line of thinking which seems to permeate through lockdown countries desperate to justify their own fatal course of action .\nIn what can only be described as a macabre display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries seem to almost eager to see Sweden fall victim to the dreaded \u201c second wave \u201d which many Britons and Americans insist is a fait accompli , as their political leaders and science \u2018 experts \u2019 keep telling them .\nPerhaps the \u2018 second wave \u2019 threats is either desperate to justify an increasingly unpopular lockdown policy , with some even floating the preferences of Bill Gates who has been publicly advocating an open-ended lockdown arrangement until such a time that salvation will arrive in the form of a vaccine for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario there would be somewhere between 18 months and two years , which begs the question of whether democracies and their economies can survive such an extended period of tumult .\nThat \u2019 s a scenario which no one can realistically endorse , and yet it \u2019 s given prime time by mainstream media outlets who have been keen of offer-up the Gates plan as the latest TINA solution to the \u2018 pandemic \u2019 .\nBesides the obvious civilizational problems with the Gates global lock-up plan , it chronically ignores the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never opted into the west \u2019 s collective self-destruction pact .\nRegarding that \u201c second wave \u201d which the American and British government keeps insisting is coming , especially if lockdown is lifted too early , renowned Scottish microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington disagrees , saying that such a second peak is unlikely .\n\u201c No , I \u2019 m not sure where this \u2018 second peak \u2019 idea comes from , \u201d says Pennington .\nStill , Prof. Pennington seemed miffed as to where Boris Johnson \u2019 s government is getting its science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from , it comes from flu .\nBecause when we have a flu pandemic we always get a second peak , and sometimes we get a third peak \u2026 .\nNow , why we should get one with this virus , I don \u2019 t quite understand \u2026 .\nIt just seems to be a phenomenon with flu , and I don \u2019 t see any reason myself , and I haven \u2019 t seen any evidence to support the idea that there would be a second peak of the virus.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental problem with lockdown policy favored by the US , UK other European countries , is that it was never evidence-based , or \u201c guided by the science.\n\u201d Quite the opposite in fact .\nRather , it was a political decision , undertaken by politicians .\nNever in history has a country enacted a universal quarantine \u2013 which quarantines the healthy as well as the sick and infirmed .\nThis also flies in the face of hundreds of years of epidemiological science and epidemic policy , and eschewing the entire concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pragmatic approach would have been to protect those most directly effected by COVID-19 which is overwhelmingly the elderly \u2013 a policy which would eventually bring a population herd immunity as a natural by-product of policy .\nThat has been the approach taken by Sweden and other states , and according to many experts \u2013 it makes sense on both an epidemiological level and well as a social and economic level .\nIn a recent interview with Radio 5 , leading Swedish epidemiologist , Dr. Johan Gieseck , remarked how the UK had initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after Boris Johnson came under intense pressure from the media and opposition , and because of the arrival of Imperial College \u2019 s notorious \u201c 500,00 dead \u201d paper presented to the government by Prof. Neil Ferguson , UK officials quickly changed course in a \u201c 180 degree U-turn.\n\u201d Gieseck said he was shocked an unpublished paper relying on computer models , and with no peer review \u2013 could have played such a crucial role in altering such an important policy decision .\nHow did that happen ?\nOne only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding between the UK government , Imperial College and the Gates Foundation to get a possible answer to that question .\nThe real question in all of this should be : who and what is driving western governments \u2019 disastrous lockdown policy .\nWe can rule out one possibility : it \u2019 s certainly not the science .\nListen

claims have now been vindicated \u2013 the US and European policy lockdowns \u2013 came too way too late as the virus had already made its way into the populations and therefore any panic measures to contain it would not be effective , and more likely could exact a massive cost on society and the economy .\nIn other words : from a pubic health and respiratory virus mitigation perspective , the lockdowns were useless .\nIn Perspectives on the Pandemic Episode 5 , John Kirby talks with Dr Wittkowski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis , and gives answers you are unlikely to see in the major media .\nNot to be missed .\nWatch : .\nSpecial thanks to Radical.org for the following transcript : [ 00:00:15.12 ] JOHN KIRBY : So , Knut , our first interview has been seen by over 1.2 million people and received thousands of largely positive comments .\nIt has also created some controversy , here and abroad , on a number of fronts , starting with allegations that you did not represent yourself accurately .\nCould you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about some of what you \u2019 ve been dealing with on this front ?\n[ 00:00:39.09 ] KNUT WITTKOWSKI : So , I have had an academic career , originally in Germany , where I worked for 15 years with Klaus Dietz , one of the leading epidemiologists at the University of Tubingen .\nAnd then I came to New York , and was , for 20 years , with the Rockefeller University , heading the Department of Biostatistics , Epidemiology and Research Design at the Center for Clinical and Translational Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being precise , but because I \u2019 m thrown dirt at , I have to be precise .\nI was never , and never claimed to be , a professor at the Rockefeller University , although , as I said , I had an academic career before .\nNow , people have corrected the factual problems they had with what I had said , because they mis-reported me , and that was Tagesschau , in Germany , which is the government-funded television station ; it was also here , a similar situation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to throw dirt at me , and in particular , they said that I had , in my own words , misrepresented myself as being a professor at the Rockefeller University , which I have never done .\n[ 00:02:12.09 ] KIRBY : What do you think is behind all that reaction ?\n[ 00:02:17.04 ] WITTKOWSKI : Well , I think if somebody says something that you don \u2019 t agree with\u2014because you have a different opinion , because you are used to praising the government\u2014and you can not attack somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facts , then you try to create a smoke screen of some allegations that are totally baseless , and use that to try and discredit somebody \u2019 s credibility .\nBut as we have seen now , and at least since yesterday in New York , the New York Times reported that at least 21 % of the population are already immune .\nI think I am now vindicated , that what I said three weeks ago , when we had the first interview here , was correct .\n[ 00:03:09.16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 % of the , the New York population , right ?\n[ 00:03:13.05 ] WITTKOWSKI : This is 21 % of the New York City population of the sample that they took ; that excludes all people who are known cases .\nThat also was a test that was skewed to rather have false negative , than false positive tests , so the actual number , probably , was higher than that , and it was a couple of days ago .\nSo , at this stage of an epidemic , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so it should , now , be much higher than it was then .\n[ 00:03:48.14 ] KIRBY : I \u2019 m struck by the partisan nature of this discussion , where any dissent from the accepted approach to the virus is dubbed as \u201c Trumpian , \u201d or its analogues in other countries , with the only acceptable approach being what is billed as \u201c the scientific consensus.\n\u201d But shouldn \u2019 t science always be an open question , subject to revision , new evidence , and debate , irrespective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to ask you , at this point , are you a Trump supporter , as some people have alleged ?\nIs that why you \u2019 ve chosen to view the crisis as you do ?\n[ 00:04:21.11 ] WITTKOWSKI : No .\nI am not , and I have never made a political statement .\nI have never singled out one party , and I have never aligned myself with one party .\nI am a scientist .\nI am looking at data , and I \u2019 m interpreting the data to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have 35 years of that , so that sometimes helps .\n[ 00:04:44.25 ] KIRBY : So , now , on to the important matters .\nSo , you \u2019 ve already alluded to this , but how has your assessment of the epidemic been born out ?\nAnd have there been other experts who have come to support your position ?\n[ 00:04:58.29 ] WITTKOWSKI : There are many people who are supporting my positions ; one was on the same channel interviewed here , that \u2019 s John Ioannidis [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several people : Wolfgang Wodarg , in Germany , there \u2019 s Sprague , there \u2019 s Helms , there are several of them .\nBut they are not favored by the media , because if you don \u2019 t present bad news , that \u2019 s not good news for the media .\nThe media\u2014only bad news is good news .\nSo , three weeks ago , I was sitting here and had already published the manuscript showing that the epidemic would be over soon , that this was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no reason whatsoever to close schools , and in particular , not to run the whole economy against the wall .\nThe damage that was done to the economy is immense .\nAnd even if there had been a few more deaths than in a regular flu , which it wasn \u2019 t , but even then , the huge damage done to the economy could not be justified by whatever was known , even at the time when people started with the so-called social distancing or the second prohibition , exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we already knew how effective the first prohibition was .\n[ 00:06:42.02 ] KIRBY : Yeah , no , no , no , it \u2019 s okay .\nSo , tell us about some of the numbers .\nWhat have you seen that bolsters your view ?\n[ 00:06:54.02 ] WITTKOWSKI : It is simply that the number of cases , even with a very liberal definition of what constitutes a case , is now dropping all over the world : in Europe and , well , it \u2019 s over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in most countries in Europe , it \u2019 s also dropping ; in others it \u2019 s leveling , and will be dropping soon .\nIt is dropping in the United States , so there is no indication anywhere this would get worse than a flu during the flu season .\nIt happens that flus are during the flu season .\n[ 00:07:37.19 ] KIRBY : One of your most intriguing contentions from our last interview was that peak infections had already been reached by the time containment was begun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over the evidence for that again and maybe you want to show the CDC graph right now ?\nFig 18 : Percentage of US Hospital Visits of Influenza-like Illness ( ILI ) .\nReported by the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network ( ILINet ) .\nWeekly national Summary , 2019-2020 and Selected Previous Seasons .\nThe 3rd peak of the 2019-20 season ( 03-16..22 ) reflects hospital utilization by COVID-19 patients , presented by the CDC director Robert R. Redfield at the 04-17 White House coronavirus briefing .\n( https : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020-04-17 04-15 data added .\n( https : //www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/images/ILI16_small.gif , accessed 04-28 ) [ 00:07:55.11 ] WITTKOWSKI : So , on the 17th , April the 17th , the Director of the CDC presented at the Presidential Briefing this graph that I am showing here .\nAnd this is data from the Influenza-Like Illness Reporting System , or ILINet , where hospitals make a checkmark , or count , how many patients show up and [ are ] having fever , sore throat , runny nose\u2014any of those\u2014and with an indication that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar [ illness ] .\nAnd what you see , and he explained that , there are three peaks : One was in December 2019 ; the other was sometime in January-February 2020 ; and then a third peak , that was around March 18th , and that was COVID-19 .\nSo , if the number of admissions , or people showing up in a hospital , peaks around March 18th , that means that the number of infections must have occurred on March 8th .\n[ 00:09:21.24 ] WITTKOWSKI : Because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd you don \u2019 t go to the hospital with the first symptoms .\nYou say , \u201c Oh , I have the flu .\nOh , I have a cold .\nWhatever , it will be over soon , \u201d and then after three or four days , if it \u2019 s not over , then you say , \u201c Well , maybe it \u2019 s something more serious , \u201d and then you go to the hospital .\nSo , what we see around the 18th must have been events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8th .\nAnd if the infections peaked around the 8th , shutting down schools , and restaurants , and the economy , about ten days later is something that is totally absurd .\nIn particular , if you know that one week later , only one week , not ten days later , one week later the curve was already clearly going down , indicating that the worst was already over .\nAnd if , in an epidemic , the worst is already over , to say , \u201c Okay , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause 26 million people [ to ] lose their jobs , because it \u2019 s so fun seeing them losing their jobs , \u201d I think that is heartless .\n[ 00:10:38.17 ] KIRBY : Okay , can we get that again ?\nWhat was the condition of New York hospitals ?\n[ 00:10:44.09 ] WITTKOWSKI : They were not overflowing .\nNew York hospitals were not overflowing .\nThey were laying off people .\n[ 00:10:51.00 ] KIRBY : And what happened with the Javits Center ?\n[ 00:10:55.21 ] KIRBY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\n[ 00:10:57.12 ] WITTKOWSKI : 300 .\n300 in the Javits Center and we were [ \u2026 ] figure 65 , 64 , 186 people in the ship , the Navy ship that came here .\nSo , if it \u2019 s a total of 500 patients , 500 patients are a drop in the bucket in the New York City hospital system .\n[ 00:11:25.10 ] KIRBY : So , the ship was not necessary ?\n[ 00:11:36.08 ] WITTKOWSKI : That may have been unfortunate for the patients , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s a different story .\n[ 00:11:43.28 ] KIRBY : Yeah .\nThat red graph , that was peak hospitalizations , right ?\n[ 00:11:50.05 ] WITTKOWSKI : That was admissions to the hospital or people showing up in hospitals .\n[ 00:11:55.23 ] KIRBY : So , we \u2019 re saying that that happened , as a nation-wide average , on March 18th ?\n[ 00:12:01.25 ] KIRBY : And the lockdown in New York occurred on March 18th .\nSo , is there any reason why public health officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any of these people , would not have been able to understand that they were at the top of a peak ?\nOr , as soon as they , the next day , saw that the rate of admissions was going down , I mean , what do you make of that ?\n[ 00:12:25.27 ] WITTKOWSKI : I have no clue .\nAnd other countries play an even more important role here , in the United States , because the United States was one week behind Europe .\nIt took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get from Europe here to the United States , so we could also already see what the epidemic was in Europe , and that it had already peaked in some European countries .\nAnd a virus doesn \u2019 t behave differently in the United States than it did in Europe .\nSo , one could , one had a lot of evidence that the virus would do , in the United States : exactly what it had done in China , and in South Korea .\nIt would peak , go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with .\nWithout any intervention .\nBecause the intervention in China came too late , they didn \u2019 t know yet what was going on .\nAnd in the South Korean government is very proud to treat people as a government in a democracy should , not to impose restrictions on people that are not absolutely necessary .\nSo , South Korea , like Sweden , and Iceland , and Belarus , they , and other countries , did not do what the United States did , and that is shut down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , create a lock-down of the whole society .\n[ 00:14:00.24 ] KIRBY : But they did\u2014South Korea did do a lot of , sort of , Orwellian contact tracing , didn \u2019 t they ?\n[ 00:14:07.01 ] WITTKOWSKI : That \u2019 s not Orwellian .\nContact tracing , so following those who are cases , and seeing what their contacts is , are things that have always been done to control epidemics .\nThat was very successful , also , with smallpox .\nThat is a reasonable thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at home and can \u2019 t go to school , that people can not go out and eat , should not meet\u2014all of these things are not reasonable .\n[ 00:14:40.25 ] KIRBY : Dr. Ioannidis feels like Neil Ferguson and people who modeled like Neil Ferguson , could have made this\u2014this could just be a big mistake , just a , kind of a , mathematical disaster , but an honest mistake .\nIs your feeling that this could all have been an honest mistake ?\n[ 00:15:05.02 ] KIRBY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford study challenged him .\nHe came out the next day and said , \u201c I \u2019 ve reduced my estimate from 500,000 in the UK to 20,000 .\nBut this is because of social distancing.\n\u201d He must know better than to say that , no ?\n[ 00:15:32.13 ] WITTKOWSKI : To know better means you have to question yourself , and some people are not capable of doing that .\nAnd that is dangerous .\n[ 00:15:43.08 ] KIRBY : It just seems so incredibly , obviously disingenuous , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c Oh , my model has changed , but it \u2019 s because we were so good , \u201d in one day ( because social distancing had only happened for one day ) , and he was saying , it \u2019 s because I can\u2014maybe , I tell we \u2019 re going to be so good , I mean , and therefore that \u2019 s why\u2014I mean , it just doesn \u2019 t make a damn bit of sense .\n[ 00:16:14.16 ] KIRBY : What could have inspired Neil Ferguson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 00:16:21.03 ] WITTKOWSKI : I don \u2019 t\u2014I have no clue .\nAnd I don \u2019 t like to engage in conspiracy theories .\nSo , if you have a model that gives results that contradict everything else , then you contact your colleagues .\nYou say , \u201c Send me your model .\nLet me try it .\nLet me compare what we have .\nWhere are we in agreement ?\nAnd what is it that makes my model different from yours ?\n\u201d This is how science works\u2014we all make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present the results without first double-checking with what other people think and what other models say .\nBecause , as a scientist , you know you are humans .\nWe always make mistakes\u2014 [ 00:17:25.17 ] KIRBY : And it would seem\u2014 [ 00:17:26.17 ] WITTKOWSKI : But we check for it , and we know how to check for it .\n[ 00:17:28.26 ] KIRBY : And it would seem that this , in particular , was a moment that required a very careful checking , and very careful peer review , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.4 % , and then Ferguson \u2019 s numbers are\u2026I don \u2019 t know what the percentage he was thinking of was , but it meant 2 million dead in the United States , and 500,000 in the UK .\n[ 00:17:52.05 ] WITTKOWSKI : Okay .\nFrankenson came out with things that were totally off the chart .\nAnd if your results are totally off the chart , you double-check them .\n[ 00:18:08.13 ] KIRBY : You said Frankenson .\nOkay .\n[ 00:18:10.20 ] KIRBY : So , say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 00:18:12.27 ] WITTKOWSKI : It \u2019 s okay .\nNo , no .\nleave it .\n[ 00:18:20.28 ] WITTKOWSKI : But this double-checking has never happened with these models , because you don \u2019 t\u2014you are not off by several orders of magnitude ; you \u2019 re off by 10-20-30 % , 50 % !\nBut that is two orders of , more than two orders of magnitude .\nEven the best social-distancing can not change something by two orders of magnitude .\nThat would mean you have to put each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolate them there .\nYes , if you do that for all 10 million people in New York , you put them a negative pressure room , then you can achieve a major difference .\nOtherwise , you can not .\nEverything you can achieve is a gradual change and we see that now with the data that we get from the , published now , in the New York Times .\nWe still have spread of the virus .\nIt may be somewhat less , but it \u2019 s not enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n[ 00:19:44.07 ] KIRBY : Would it have been easy for public health officials to predict , based on prior experiences with economic depressions , that the lockdown would cause more excess death than the virus ?\nI mean , in terms of suicide , like\u2014 [ 00:20:00.07 ] WITTKOWSKI : It was known to everybody that the lockdown would cause a catastrophe , there is no question .\nIf you shut down the economy of the United States and other countries in the western world , that this is creating hardship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine .\nAnd we don \u2019 t see it yet .\nSo , we don \u2019 t have\u2014I haven \u2019 t seen , for instance , data on suicides yet .\nSo , we don \u2019 t see\u2014we have seen 26 million people in the United States losing their job , and we see a lot of businesses going bankrupt .\n[ 00:20:47.16 ] There is substantial spread of virus , despite all of that distancing .\nIt may be that some people are actually beginning to start thinking , because , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing , how effective is the distancing ?\nIt \u2019 s not effective !\nIt \u2019 s not doing it .\nIt \u2019 s slowing down the spread .\nBut it \u2019 s not preventing it .\n[ 00:21:26.16 ] KIRBY : But , what they would say to you is , didn \u2019 t that help ease the strain on our healthcare system ?\nThat that was the point , to slow down the spread .\n[ 00:21:36.08 ] WITTKOWSKI : Where is the strain on our healthcare system ?\n[ 00:21:38.13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that we did this distancing , and therefore , there was no strain .\n[ 00:21:45.09 ] KIRBY : Well , but how would you seriously answer that ?\n[ 00:21:48.10 ] WITTKOWSKI : Isolating the nursing homes would be the thing that would have prevented death and would have prevented hospitals from becoming overloaded .\nNot letting children and young adults become infected and develop immunity does not reduce the risk or the load on hospitals .\n[ 00:22:20.11 ] KIRBY : Back to some epidemiology : Professor Isaac Ben-Israel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that the virus is self-limiting , peaking after 40 days and then rapidly declining , largely vanishing after 70 days , no matter what interventions are put in place .\nDoes that make sense to you and why would that happen ?\n[ 00:22:39.13 ] WITTKOWSKI : Every respiratory disease virus does that .\nAnd that is , simply : it spreads ; people get infected or exposed , mostly without having symptoms ; they become immune ; eventually more people are immune than susceptible ; and at that point in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a couple of weeks .\n[ 00:23:06.03 ] KIRBY : But , does that happen even if you don \u2019 t infect 80 % of a population ?\n[ 00:23:12.14 ] WITTKOWSKI : This is how humankind has survived the last maybe 100,000 years .\n[ 00:23:17.26 ] KIRBY : But back in March , back in before mid-March , or let \u2019 s take what you say is the peak , the peak in hospital admissions is the 18th , and so the peak of infections must have been earlier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the point of peak infection , and it starts to fall , is that the point of herd immunity ?\nOr does that mean that herd immunity is approaching ?\nWhat does that mean in terms of\u2014 [ 00:23:50.12 ] WITTKOWSKI : So , herd immunity\u2014we \u2019 re talking [ of ] herd immunity as the state where no imported infection causes secondary infections anymore , that is herd immunity .\nBut what we are seeing here , is herd immunity building : we are approaching herd immunity , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune increasing .\nAnd what is actually needed\u2026 .\nThree weeks ago , I said 80 % .\nIt depends on that basic reproduction number R0 [ pronounced \u2018 are-knot \u2019 ] , which we don \u2019 t know .\nIt could well be that R0 is a bit lower than the 2.2 that I assumed at that point in time\u2014maybe it \u2019 s only 1.8 and then we need only 60 or 70 % \u2014but the important thing is , that the process had already started , very early on .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens with all respiratory diseases .\nSo , even if there is a flu that we don \u2019 t have a vaccine against , it comes , stays for 2 , 3 , 4 weeks , and is gone .\nSo , I think he \u2019 s very pessimistic to say 70 days ; that includes the very ends , where we don \u2019 t really see anything , if we look , and to the period where we actually see cases .\nThat \u2019 s more\u2014I would say it \u2019 s half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t really matter , because , in principle , we all , all epidemiologists agree on that .\nI couldn \u2019 t say , I wouldn \u2019 t know anybody who would disagree that this is how respiratory diseases get into a population , spread , and get extinguished .\n[ 00:25:41.10 ] KIRBY : Since you mentioned the R0 value , I have a missive here from a science teacher in England .\nIs he right to say that an R0 of 2.2 needs about 55 % resistant people to have herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need less people with an R0 of 2.2 ?\n[ 00:26:06.07 ] WITTKOWSKI : I don \u2019 t want to go there because part of the problem is that these calculations assume that you have a homogenous population , and the population isn \u2019 t homogenous .\nAnd if you want to do something in a non-homogenous population , then things change a bit , but not fundamentally .\nThe important thing is , you don \u2019 t need to do anything to prevent disease from running\u2014a respiratory disease\u2014from running .\nWhat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not done in the United States , is to protect the elderly .\nFrom the experience in Italy , we already knew that the vast majority of people who die are people in their 70 \u2019 s , 80 \u2019 s and 90 \u2019 s who have comorbidities .\nSo that was nothing new when it also happened in Seattle .\nWe had the very early experience , in Seattle , of a couple of people , old people with comorbidities , dying in a nursing home .\nAt that point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the nursing homes .\nPay the nurses and everybody working there overtime so that they can stay there for three or four weeks .\nSorry , my voice is breaking because I think that is a tragedy .\nThis opportunity was missed .\nInstead , people were isolating the children , who are not at risk at all .\n[ 00:27:49.00 ] You still don \u2019 t really know whether children are infected or not , and if they are infected , they never , or virtually never , develop a phenotype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at risk , and put those at risk who are at risk , is a catastrophe .\nIt \u2019 s a human catastrophe that should never , ever have happened .\nAnd if people say they don \u2019 t have money for that , for 2 trillion dollars you can pay a lot of overtime .\nYou could have made all of these people millionaires , and there would be a lot of money left , and we would have really protected the virus from getting into the nursing homes and killing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 00:28:43.16 ] KIRBY : All we \u2019 ve really done , you \u2019 re suggesting , in addition to not adequately protecting the old , we have slowed the spread of herd immunity .\n[ 00:28:55.09 ] WITTKOWSKI : Yes .\nAnd that means we have increased the risk of the elderly to become infected .\nBecause you can not isolate yourself for extended periods of time .\nIsolation for a short period of time is easy .\nBut for a long period of time , it \u2019 s just human\u2014the grandparents want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] KIRBY : So , now , they \u2019 re going to be in a situation where , because herd immunity has not fully developed , they \u2019 ll come back out into the world and the virus will still be there ?\n[ 00:29:36.01 ] WITTKOWSKI : The virus is still around .\nSo , we still have to isolate the elderly .\nWe are no more better , so the time that has passed is wasted .\nYou still have to do , actually , we have to do more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be not so high , but wider .\nSo , the time the elderly and the nursing homes have to be isolated would be more than it otherwise would have been .\n[ 00:30:21.07 ] KIRBY : Is there no way around that ?\n[ 00:30:23.15 ] WITTKOWSKI : No .\nThe only thing we have to do is to do what we should have done in the first place : keep the schools open , keep the businesses open , and isolate the elderly .\n[ 00:31:28.19 ] WITTKOWSKI : Healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done reasonably well .\nIt is the existence of comorbidities , in addition to being old , that really causes a problem .\nAnd we are\u2014for instance , I have asthma , but my asthma is very well controlled , so I \u2019 m not really scared .\nBut if somebody has more severe forms of asthma , that might be a factor .\nBut , those people who have these conditions are aware of it .\nIt \u2019 s not that you have a severe problem with your health and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be extremely rare .\n[ 00:32:08.22 ] KIRBY : And among young children , I mean\u2026respiratory viruses can be very dangerous for them , can \u2019 t they ?\n[ 00:32:17.00 ] WITTKOWSKI : Not really .\nAt least they may\u2014sometimes there is a virus that effects younger people as well .\nI \u2019 m not aware of children\u2014one thing that we have with children is , they have innate immunity because they didn \u2019 t have time or the experience to build up the adaptive immunity , where we have antibodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system that is primed to be exposed to diseases or viruses [ that ] they don \u2019 t have immunity against , and they typically do well with it .\nSo the childhood diseases are not causing that many problems .\nWe are not vaccinating children for rubella because rubella is such a bad disease for children .\nWe are vaccinating children against rubella because we don \u2019 t want women of child- , who are pregnant , to become infected without having immunity and then having the side-effects or the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Mirror Crack \u2019 d from Side to Side .\n[ 00:33:35.00 ] KIRBY : In yesterday \u2019 s press conference , one of your suggestions seems to have been picked up by the President \u2019 s advisors , namely that sunshine , heat , and being outdoors may \u201c kill \u201d the virus .\nBut Bill Gates , in his latest pandemic memo , says \u201c Almost all respiratory viruses , a group that includes COVID-19 , are seasonal .\nThis would mean there are fewer infections in the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall comes .\nThis is a matter of degree , because we see the novel coronavirus spreading in Australia , and other places in the Southern Hemisphere , where the seasons are the opposite of ours .\nWe already know the virus is not as seasonal as influenza is.\n\u201d What do you say to that ?\n[ 00:34:23.04 ] WITTKOWSKI : It does not really matter whether it is so seasonal or not .\nIt seems to be seasonal in the Northern Hemisphere .\nWhat \u2019 s happening right now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was an epidemic\u2014but it didn \u2019 t last very long either , and ended .\nThe important thing is : wherever a respiratory disease spreads , it doesn \u2019 t last very long .\nAs the\u2014my colleague , Ben-Israel said , it vanishes after a predictable , relatively short period of time , and that is , [ it ] doesn \u2019 t have anything to do with the weather .\nIt is true that most epidemics start when it is cold , in the winter .\nBut that doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , under certain circumstances , also be in the summer .\nWe don \u2019 t know .\n[ 00:35:22.25 ] KIRBY : Well , Bill Gates is not a doctor or an epidemiologist .\nAnd , incidentally , I think it should be mentioned , his computer operating system\u2014 [ 00:35:31.21 ] WITTKOWSKI : Well , he knows a lot about spreading operating systems .\n[ 00:35:36.23 ] KIRBY : Which are , themselves , notoriously susceptible to viruses .\nDo you have any thoughts about why the world seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 00:35:48.16 ] WITTKOWSKI : I had never heard of him as , and never read any publications on epidemiology by Bill Gates , but maybe I overlooked some of his qualifications .\n[ 00:36:05.25 ] KIRBY : But , why is he on the news every night , telling us what we should be doing and how\u2014well , let me say something else that he says .\nHe says that , \u201c every additional month that it takes to get the vaccine is a month when the economy can not return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement ?\n[ 00:36:27.09 ] WITTKOWSKI : No .\nIt \u2019 s absurd .\nIt has nothing to do with reality .\nNo epidemiologist would ever say anything like\u2014with one example , we have one person , who calls himself an epidemiologist , and is seen as an epidemiologist in Britain , who makes statements like that as well .\n[ 00:36:55.22 ] WITTKOWSKI : The virus is gone .\nWhat do we need a vaccine for ?\n[ 00:37:02.23 ] KIRBY : And you \u2019 re pro-vaccine , right ?\nYou \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] WITTKOWSKI : I \u2019 m not anti-vaccine .\nI \u2019 m taking vaccine shots every year , and if there should be a vaccine around for the coronavirus , I would take it too , if it \u2019 s tested and shown to be safe .\nI don \u2019 t see any reason not to take it .\nBut here we have a particular virus that stays in the population , as all respiratory disease viruses do , for a couple of weeks and then it \u2019 s gone .\nWhy should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t make sense .\n[ 00:37:42.02 ] WITTKOWSKI : We don \u2019 t need a vaccine to get out of it .\nWe don \u2019 t\u2014sorry for Bill Gates\u2014but we don \u2019 t need a vaccine .\nIt is nice to have it in case this virus should come back again and if we then have a vaccine that will be nice .\nDo we need it right now ?\nNo .\nWe don \u2019 t need a vaccine because we see already herd immunity developing and in two or three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd immunity and it \u2019 s over .\n[ 00:38:20.23 ] KIRBY : Bill Gates , Trump , Doctors Fauci and Burke , and Neil Ferguson , of Imperial College , believe the lockdowns were necessary .\nTrump reiterated , again , this week that 1 to 2 million people would have died in this country were it not for the lockdown .\nOn the other hand , you have people like renowned German infectious disease expert Dr. Sushari Bakti\u2014is that how you pronounce his name\u2014who called Germany \u2019 s anti-COVID measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous .\nThe life expectancy of millions is being shattered.\n\u201d He referred to the impact on the world economy as horrifying and said , \u201c All these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook.\n\u201d I know we have just covered this , but I should just ask you , which of those two positions do you agree with and why ?\n[ 00:39:07.03 ] WITTKOWSKI : I agree with him whole-heartedly .\nI agree with the Swedish government .\nI agree with John Ioannidis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have read about , with Ben-Israel .\nI don \u2019 t know where the government finds these so-called experts that obviously do not understand the very basics of epidemiology .\n[ 00:39:46.12 ] KIRBY : We \u2019 ve already spoken about New York .\nThere are two other important studies that have occurred recently , one in Santa Clara County , in California , and the other in L.A. County .\nThe Santa Clara study indicated\u2014and these are antibody serology tests , and if you could maybe , when I finish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like 50-85 times the reported cases had likely been infected , usually asymptomatically .\nI am just wondering if you could comment on their tests and what it means for the rest of the country .\n[ 00:40:23.18 ] WITTKOWSKI : As we have seen now , the first , I think , was in Germany , in one of the hardest hit cities , in Heimsheim , where a study was done\u2014that was about three weeks ago , if I remember right , where they had 15 % seropositive .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data from California , that was 5 % ; now we have those here in New York at 21 % .\nWe have evidence everywhere in the world where it was tested , that there is\u2014people are developing antibodies .\nNow , you were asking what that means .\nIt means that people are getting infected ; the virus gets into some cells ; the cells are expressing some of the virus DNA on their surface ; this gets read by the immune system ; the immune system takes about a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind against the cells that are expressing this virus DNA or RNA , and then these cells get all killed by the immune system , which is causing the phenotype that we experience .\nThat is what \u2019 s causing the sore throat , the coughing , and all the effects that we see .\nIt \u2019 s not the virus itself , it \u2019 s the immune system , the cytokine storm , whatever you call it , that is attacking cells and over-attacking cells that are infected , and that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] KIRBY : Why wouldn \u2019 t the government , the federal government , have conducted randomized serology tests much earlier ?\n[ 00:42:17.12 ] WITTKOWSKI : That would have been reasonable .\n[ 00:42:22.25 ] KIRBY : Can you imagine any reasonable reason why they wouldn \u2019 t have ?\n[ 00:42:29.24 ] WITTKOWSKI : I \u2019 m not sure that this particular antibody test was available at that particular time .\nHowever , I think if the efforts in doing PCR tests for active virus had been spent on antibodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy decisions much earlier .\nWe would have the data .\nIt \u2019 s one of the examples , I mentioned that in the last talk , there is a fundamental difference [ in ] how physicians and epidemiologists think .\nA physician sees the individual patient and wants to do the best for this patient , and thinks , \u201c Well , it would be good to know if that patient is actually infected by a particular virus.\n\u201d Not that it would make much of a difference anyway , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand that .\nAn epidemiologist would say , \u201c We want to know how many , which proportion of the population has already developed antibodies , and so is immune against the virus , so that we know what policy decisions should be made.\n\u201d Is it necessary to shut down the country , or is it not necessary ?\nAnd this is where you need antibody tests .\nSo , the virus tests and antibody tests serve different purposes , and you need people with a different profession and experience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard .\n[ 00:44:03.03 ] This flu was no different from other flus .\nWhy should we suddenly say , \u201c Oh , now we have to change our life forever ?\n\u201d [ 00:44:16.14 ] KIRBY : But what about people who say it \u2019 s much more intensive ?\nAnd the effects , there are two things : one , that it seemed to hit , in particular , a place like New York , all at once , very hard ; and then , it seemed to have ill-effects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu , whereas , like , maybe perhaps , less of a recovery rate .\nWhat do you say to that objection ?\nThat this was different in those ways ?\n[ 00:44:46.17 ] WITTKOWSKI : We have no indication that it is different , fundamentally different , from any other flu .\nThe New York hospital system was quite capable of dealing with it .\nThe hospital ship , the Javits Center , all of that was unnecessary .\nWe had enough respirators , there was no\u2014people were afraid that something might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 00:45:18.10 ] KIRBY : Though , you hear from doctors who \u2019 ve been dealing with this , and nurses , and they are telling , you know , very difficult stories to hear .\nVery , you know , sad stories about what \u2019 s been going on .\n[ 00:45:33.25 ] WITTKOWSKI : You always have individual places somewhere , where some individuals experience something dramatic\u2014that happens .\nAnd the bad thing is that , for the media , only a bad story is a good story , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly-emotional experiences .\nAnd I don \u2019 t say it \u2019 s not there , but it \u2019 s not representative .\nIt \u2019 s not typical .\nTragic stories happen all the time .\nSome here , some there .\nIt happens , but we don \u2019 t stop living our life because , in one place or another , something goes wrong .\nWe learn from it and we try to prevent it from happening again .\nBut we are not saying , \u201c Oh no .\nNow we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flu during the flu season.\n\u201d [ 00:46:55.08 ] KIRBY : No , it \u2019 s very confusing\u2026I mean , it \u2019 s very confusing why we \u2019 re having this response to what should be a seasonal event .\n[ 00:47:08.14 ] WITTKOWSKI : I think it is a side-effect of the internet , of rumors spreading on the internet at a speed that is unprecedented , and the normal controlled mechanisms to do factual checks , real factual checks , don \u2019 t work at that speed , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a lot more fear , and fear is something that is dangerous .\n[ 00:47:43.20 ] KIRBY : As bleak as that interpretation is , it \u2019 s very generous to the many groups that are going to benefit from this event , like the people being bailed out on Wall Street .\n[ 00:47:56.27 ] WITTKOWSKI : I \u2019 m sure some people benefitted from it .\nI mean , there were some people [ who ] knew in advance what was happening , and , I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , where the President got advice from different people , and some people who gave the advice may have had some knowledge that other people did not have , and therefore the ability to act on that knowledge .\n[ 00:48:35.11 ] KIRBY : Well , who \u2019 s going to benefit from this idea that life can never be the same again ?\nWho benefits from that ?\n[ 00:48:44.11 ] WITTKOWSKI : I don \u2019 t know .\nSo , I can see people benefitting , and we say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President that the market is , the stock market , is going up .\nIf the economy is shut down , and at the same time we shorten , and then we benefit from our shortening.\n\u201d I can see that , but I don \u2019 t see how somebody benefits from saying , \u201c Well , now we have to change our entire life.\n\u201d [ 00:49:16.15 ] KIRBY : What about Fauci saying we should never shake hands again ?\nWhat do you think of that ?\n[ 00:49:24.15 ] WITTKOWSKI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even there , I can not see who benefits from not shaking hands .\nYes , a few viruses are not being transmitted , so in the end , we would have a bit less flu infections , if we are not shaking hands anymore , big deal .\nBecause so far , we have survived hand shaking , and we probably would survive handshaking for another few thousand years .\n[ 00:50:00.11 ] KIRBY : But it \u2019 s very sad to think that certain\u2014like , ritual forms of human contact\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek-kissing and these things\u2014they seem to be under attack , this new normal .\n[ 00:50:16.24 ] WITTKOWSKI : I mean , even Dr. Strangelove was concerned about the exchange of bodily fluids .\nAnd I could see that becoming a problem .\nAnd maybe we should totally abolish this .\nAnd therefore , abolish the existence of the human race , just because we had a flu here .\n[ 00:50:40.11 ] KIRBY : Let \u2019 s talk about the case of Sweden .\nMost of the reporting in the major media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reckless in its approach , and a failure , yet we just received a report from a Swedish American reporter that at their most recent press conference , the Chief Medical Officer said , \u201c The curve is very flat , really since the beginning of April , and that \u2019 s very good news .\nIt \u2019 s very good news .\nThere \u2019 s no rise in cases in Stockholm at all.\n\u201d So , what do you make of the Swedish approach and what does it tell us now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedish approach tells us that this respiratory disease epidemic behaves like every other respiratory disease epidemic and does not require the draconian measures that were taken in many countries in the world .\nWhat is happening in Sweden is not fundamentally different from what \u2019 s happening in the United States .\nWhether it \u2019 s a bit higher or a bit lower , it doesn \u2019 t make that much of a difference .\nAt least in Sweden , people didn \u2019 t get unemployed , they didn \u2019 t run their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did China .\nSo , I think China will have a huge benefit from the United States running their economy against the wall , because now China has the opportunity to benefit .\n[ 00:52:07.23 ] KIRBY : You spoke last time about the lockdown virtually guaranteeing a second wave .\nIn the Swedish press conference , which we \u2019 ve translated , thanks to the reporting of Celia Farber , the Health Minister said something that struck me along those same lines .\nHe said , \u201c You \u2019 re talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you do lockdown , it \u2019 s always a worry when you \u2019 ve had total lockdown that you \u2019 ll get a sudden spike of very many cases and many people who weren \u2019 t infected will be hit .\nIn Sweden , we \u2019 ve had a low spread the whole time .\nProbably also in the schools , which means we don \u2019 t have to worry about these spikes.\n\u201d So , what does that mean for us , that we have had this sort of lockdown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we going to see these spikes ?\nAre we going to see extra waves because of this lockdown ?\n[ 00:53:00.26 ] WITTKOWSKI : Three weeks ago , that was something I was afraid of , that it might happen .\nWhat we now see is , people got infected nonetheless .\nSo , we now have at least 25 % in New York who are already immune .\nSo , even if we just stop right away , having 25 % in the population immune is a very effective barrier against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a rebound , but the rebound will be very low , and take some time .\nSo , we will have a flat curve of rebound that will not have any major impact on health or any other indicators .\n[ 00:53:51.04 ] KIRBY : Of course , we \u2019 re being told that we do not know whether having the antibodies makes you immune .\nDoesn \u2019 t that seem to sort of fly in the face of most immunology and indeed the whole basis for vaccination ?\n[ 00:54:06.01 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I \u2019 m jumping out of the window , if I will die as soon as I hit the street .\nI don \u2019 t know because I haven \u2019 t done it yet .\nBut , experience tells that most people who jump out of the window from the 4th , 5th , or 6th floor die .\nAnd this is the same situation here .\nWe know what all other respiratory viruses did and there is no reason to believe that this respiratory virus will be fundamentally different from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are very well aware of .\n[ 00:54:45.22 ] What I find strange and totally illogical , is that there is now this mantra that , \u201c we will never go back to where we were before.\n\u201d And I think about it and I say , \u201c Why not ?\n\u201d If the virus is gone , we can go back , like Camus in The Plague .\nIt \u2019 s over , we go back to normal .\nWhy are people talking about , \u201c Well , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d I don \u2019 t see any reason .\nThere was a plague , it was terrible , it \u2019 s over .\nLet \u2019 s go back and have a life .\n[ 00:55:40.04 ] KIRBY : I mean , why-why do you think they \u2019 re saying it ?\n[ 00:55:44.19 ] WITTKOWSKI : I have no clue .\nThe only thing I know is , it does not make any sense .\nYou , if you think social distancing makes sense during the time where the virus is around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , fine .\nThen , do the social distancing while the virus is around .\nBut if the virus is gone , why continue ?\nWhy not go back to normal ?\n[ 00:56:20.10 ] KIRBY : You made reference last time to ostensible COVID deaths being \u201c found in a shoebox , \u201d as it were , in France and Germany , which added deceptively to the sense of a spike in cases .\nRecently , we in New York , were told that 4,000 we \u2019 ll call them \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rolls .\nFirst of all , what do you think of that procedure and how they went about doing it ?\nWe were assured this is making it more accurate , but it seemed somewhat arbitrary to\u2014what do you think ?\n[ 00:56:52.05 ] WITTKOWSKI : I haven \u2019 t seen another place where the data is so chaotic as in New York , with the potential exception of Germany , which also screwed up a lot .\n[ 00:57:04.23 ] KIRBY : What do you make of the CDC and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths ?\n[ 00:57:12.24 ] WITTKOWSKI : This is one way to artificially inflate numbers , to give the politicians a bit of\u2026to cover their gluteus maximus .\nI don \u2019 t see any other reason why you should call something something that it isn \u2019 t on the death certificate .\n[ 00:57:35.25 ] KIRBY : Or something that you don \u2019 t know , if you don \u2019 t know what it is\u2014 [ 00:57:40.18 ] KIRBY : So , that leads us to ask , theoretically , can the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than flawed or even possibly rigged tests and non-standard death coding procedures ?\nIs it possible that this may have happened in the case of COVID-19 ?\n[ 00:58:00.19 ] WITTKOWSKI : Okay .\nI \u2019 m not\u2026 .\nI have to admit .\nI \u2019 m not quite sure what the current definition of a \u201c pandemic \u201d is , because that also changed recently .\nBut , it is a disease that spreads across ten world , so you could say , \u201c Yeah , it is a pandemic.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pandemic .\nThe question is : what are we going to do about it , or not ?\n[ 00:58:24.24 ] KIRBY : Fair enough .\nSo , we agree that there is something that \u2019 s novel , a novel coronavirus of some kind is spreading , but it does seem that , given these coding procedures , and given some of the problems with the PCR testing , including contaminated tests , etc.\n, that it is possible that the numbers associated with the pandemic are very , very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 00:58:51.08 ] WITTKOWSKI : Now , first let me comment on the \u201c novel virus.\n\u201d Every virus that spreads is \u201c novel.\n\u201d If it were not novel , it would not spread , because then we would have antibodies against it .\nSo , having a novel virus is nothing novel .\nIt is just routine .\nIt happens every year .\nThis year , we had three waves of viruses , and yes , they were different types of virus , but if you look into this more carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the influenza A epidemics that we had prior to having the COVID epidemic were probably also caused by novel variants of these viruses .\n[ 00:59:43.29 ] KIRBY : Is this virus any more contagious than influenza ?\n[ 00:59:51.04 ] WITTKOWSKI : We have no evidence that there are any fundamental differences in infectivity .\nThe only evidence , or the only finding is that , in some countries \u2019 cases , it seems this virus is more lethal to the elderly than other , than influenza viruses typically are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] KIRBY : Is there any science behind the actual numbers in social distancing ?\nYou know , 6 feet as opposed to 7 or 5 or , in terms of\u2026 ?\nAnd wearing masks ?\nAnd , you know , no cash , things like that ?\nIs there-is there science ?\nWhat is the science behind that , as far as you know ?\n[ 01:00:40.07 ] WITTKOWSKI : Well , every statement about an empty set is true .\n[ 01:00:48.12 ] WITTKOWSKI : No , that \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no science .\nSo , you can say anything about science , but there is none .\nWe don \u2019 t have any science that tells us how effective social distancing is , we have no comparison .\nThe only comparison that we have is the comparison that , in countries like Sweden , like Iceland , like South Korea , like Belarus , that it doesn \u2019 t seem to be much different .\nSo , whatever the effect is , it \u2019 s unlikely to have any major impact .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] If people would be more active , if they would take part in political decisions , if they would be more awake , if they would fight for their democratic rights , this would never have happened .\nIt \u2019 s a failure of the people to take control of the government , and let the government take control of them .\n[ 01:02:06.26 ] KIRBY : Let me ask you the final question then .\nWhat should we do right now ?\nI mean , it seems that the flatter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are , the more lockdown measures are being put in place .\nWe were just asked by our mayor to inform on citizens who were not practicing social distancing .\nIt seems that , you know , we \u2019 re now being asked to wear masks on the street , no matter what we \u2019 re doing .\nWhat do you make of all this , and how should we respond ?\n[ 01:02:41.12 ] WITTKOWSKI : It \u2019 s ridiculous .\nSo , what we should do immediately , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd immunity , in spite of the social distancing , at least to some level ?\nWe have immunity in a quite relevant portion of the population , we should open schools and businesses yesterday , at the latest !\nThere is no reason whatsoever to wait .\nThe worst thing that could happen is , we get a bit of a rebound that will not be catastrophic , that will not overload the hospitals , it will be less than we had so far .\nThat could happen .\nBut everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what could happen if we , let \u2019 s say , have another 10-20,000 cases .\nCould be .\nIt \u2019 s not the end of the world .\nWe should go back to be [ ing ] a strong economy , to work , to have a social life , to let children be educated , do everything our society should do .\nAnd that lockdown is\u2026there is no benefit .\nIt has only negative effects .", "author": "21wire", "url":

"source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "Nobel Laureate: \u2018Coronavirus Lockdown Policy Was Huge Mistake, There Will Be a Reckoning\u2019", "content": "This is a very revealing interview .\nAs the US and UK continue their disastrous \u2018 lockdown \u2019 policy , derelict politicians and mainstream media pundits are slow to acknowledge the serious damage on the economic and societal fronts is building .\nLeaders seem determined to double-down of what seems to be a failed policy of virus containment even though scientists had already shown that the crisis had in fact peaked some weeks ago .\nAccording to Professor Michael Levitt from Standford University \u2019 s School of Medicine , \u201c There is no doubt in my mind , that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the damage done by lockdown will exceed any saving of lives by a huge factor.\n\u201d In other words , the \u2018 cure \u2019 of government mandated mass-quarantine is actually worse than the disease .\nProf. Levitt also points out that Sweden should be seen as a clear winner in term of its choice to avoid lockdown policy .\nProf Levitt believes the UK was actually on the right path when Boris Johnson had initially unveiled a plan similar to Sweden \u2019 s , but was then quickly pressured by a media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 lockdown \u2019 approach .\n\u201c I think the policy of herd immunity is the right policy .\nI think Britain was on exactly the right track before they were fed wrong numbers .\nAnd they made a huge mistake.\n\u201d He also added that there should be a lesson learned going forward should be not to accept the diktats of political leaders and their appointed \u2018 experts \u2019 at face value , while warning that : \u201c There will be a reckoning .\nMaybe countries will start to see that they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric , but [ who are ] actually thinking [ when ] doing things .\nI often go back and think about what Socrates said 2,400 years ago , \u2018 Use your common sense , instead of listening to the rhetoric of leaders.\n\u201d As he is careful to point out , Professor Michael Levitt is not an epidemiologist .\nHe \u2019 s Professor of Structural Biology at the Stanford School of Medicine , and winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for \u201c the development of multiscale models for complex chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy \u2014 as he told us in our interview , his wife says he loves numbers more than her \u2014 but then , much of modern science is really about statistics ( as his detractors never tire of pointing out , Professor Neil Ferguson is a theoretical physicist by training ) .\nWith a purely statistical perspective , he has been playing close attention to the Covid-19 pandemic since January , when most of us were not even aware of it .\nHe first spoke out in early February , when through analysing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubei province he predicted with remarkable accuracy that the epidemic in that province would top out at around 3,250 deaths .\nHis observation is a simple one : that in outbreak after outbreak of this disease , a similar mathematical pattern is observable regardless of government interventions .\nAfter around a two week exponential growth of cases ( and , subsequently , deaths ) some kind of break kicks in , and growth starts slowing down .\nThe curve quickly becomes \u201c sub-exponential \u201d .\nThis may seem like a technical distinction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 unmitigated \u2019 scenarios modelled by ( among others ) Imperial College , and which tilted governments across the world into drastic action , relied on a presumption of continued exponential growth \u2014 that with a consistent R number of significantly above 1 and a consistent death rate , very quickly the majority of the population would be infected and huge numbers of deaths would be recorded .\nBut Professor Levitt \u2019 s point is that that hasn \u2019 t actually happened anywhere , even in countries that have been relatively lax in @ @ @ @ @

to abate , rather than relax draconian \u2018 lockdown \u2019 measures , certain governments like the UK and France are choosing instead to carry on with the systematic implosion of their economies and societies .\nThis is certainly a puzzling state of affairs and highly counter intuitive , especially considering the fact the other non-lockdown countries like Sweden have already come through the crisis with minimal casualties .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the public are being constantly told by government officials that lockdowns are all about \u201c saving lives.\n\u201d Upon closer examination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold water , not least of all as evidence of massive collateral damage is already visible and will continue to threaten people , families and destabilize society for months , years or decades , depending on how long governments are intent on keeping the pressure on their citizens .\nThe public is now asking : on what legitimate basis have government \u2018 experts \u2019 triggered mass-panic and proceeded to make such sweeping and world-changing policy decisions ?\nThe following is a moving piece by Peter Hitchens a columnist at The Mail On Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most

the Government \u2019 s policy on Covid-19 is a mistake .\nMost people do not agree with me , and many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others , bafflingly , don \u2019 t care about the greatest crisis I have seen in my lifetime , and regard the debate as a spectator sport .\nLet me say it again : the coronavirus is not as dangerous as claimed .\nOther comparable epidemics have taken place with far less fuss , and we have survived them .\nThe death rate is lower than the Government believed .\nIt passed its peak in this country on April 8 , well before the crazy measures introduced by the Government on March 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions we are taking against it are gravely out of proportion and will destroy the lives of thousands and the prosperity and health of millions .\nThis is not life versus money .\nIt is life versus life .\nIt has not been much fun fighting this .\nIn fact , it has been exhausting and dispiriting .\nI feel as if I am in a nightmare where I can see a terrible danger approaching but when I cry out in warning , nobody can hear me .\nCan \u2019 t you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you don \u2019 t defend your most basic freedom , the one to go lawfully where you wish when you

true but I am sure that plenty of tenants are not paying and plenty of landlords are losing what they thought was guaranteed income .\nYou don \u2019 t care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other cases , the normal flow of money in exchange for work , services and goods has just stopped .\nImagine if something similar were happening to your own body .\nYou would be desperately sick and only urgent aid would save you from long-term damage .\nBut where is that urgent aid ?\nThe country is having a gigantic self-inflicted heart attack and stroke combined .\nHeaven knows what sort of trembling , weakened shadow of its former self it will be when this is over .\nI think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 will need to take many doses of very bitter medicine for as far into the future as it is possible to see .\nAnd yet no help comes .\nThe absurd jocular Mr Bumble who we have chosen to be our national leader at this time has no sense of urgency at all .\nAs he stammers and brays , and does his

flinching with real alarm at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubonic plague were abroad .\nThey genuinely fear to go back to normal life .\nAnd Mr Bumble dare not take them on .\nFor to do so he would have to admit that he had been wrong , and the great pyramid of fear on which his authority is based would crumble away .\nHe is like the Sorcerer \u2019 s Apprentice in the Disney film Fantasia , who casts a spell to summon an army of automatons to carry water for him , and is almost drowned because he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop what he began .\nIf someone else can not stop it for him , it may destroy him .\nSo we face months of continuing idiocy , as the wealth of centuries is frittered away for nothing and we sink into a grim penury , made worse by the increasing lack of freedom and the insolence of authority .\nEventually there will be an accounting for this .\nIt ought to be soon , and I hope it will be .\nBut if not , it will be important that protests such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time .\nNobody will be able to say , when the much-needed inquiry eventually sits in judgment on these times and on those responsible , that criticism is just hindsight and that nobody pointed out at the time that a

conflict\u2014if people around the world knew the truth about this war , it would come to a screeching halt overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research in matters relating to war , I have come to understand one very important thing : When human societies lose their freedom , it \u2019 s usually not because the monarch , the state , or some dictator has overtly taken it away .\nRather , it is lost because too many people willingly surrender their freedom in return for protection from some perceived ( real or imagined ) menace .\nThat menace is typically manufactured by the state and is designed to stir up such a torrent of fear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians to implement measures against the fabricated threat .\nUnfortunately , it rarely occurs to the public to ask : Are we simply reacting to an orchestrated threat ?\nWill the protective measures we \u2019 re demanding of our leaders actually work ?\nOr will \u201c the cure \u201d being offered to us be worse than \u201c the disease \u201d

"content": "The mortality statistics for COVID 19 have been incessantly hammered into our heads by the mainstream media ( MSM ) .\nEvery day they report these hardest of facts to justify the lockdown ( house arrest ) and to prove to us that living in abject fear of the COVID 19 syndrome is the only sensible reaction .\nApparently , only the most lucrative vaccine ever devised can possibly save us

manipulated , inflated , fudged and exploited tell us something else ?\nThe Once Reliable Office Of National Statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( another qualified doctor ) was introduced in 2016 following a series of high profile systemic abuses .\nThe mass murderer Dr Harold Shipman , and doctors at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and Southern Health NHS Trust , covered up crimes and widespread malpractice by improperly completing MCCD \u2019 s .\nToday , once the Medical Examiner agrees , they then discusses the death with a qualified informant .\nThis is usually someone who knows the deceased .\nIt is an opportunity , more often than not , for a family member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggested cause of death .\nIf no further issues are raised , the death certificate can be issued to the informant , the Local Registrar notified and the death recorded .\nRegistered deaths have been recorded in England and Wales since 1837 .\nFrom 1911 onward the cause of death has been coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) .\nMaintaining registration records was the responsibility of the General Register Office until 1970 when it became a department of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merged with the Central Statistical Office ( CSO ) to form the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) .\nThere have been some tweaks and legislative changes to the system over the years .\nTechnology has sped things up a bit , but essentially the simple process of recording registered deaths has changed little over the last century .\nThe ONS have been accurately recording registered deaths in England and Wales for more than 23 years .\nFrom a statistical perspective this consistent , verifiable system has allowed meaningful analysis to inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe inbuilt safeguards , maintained and improved over the years , means the ONS provide some of the most reliable mortality statistics in the world .\nThey record all registered deaths no matter where they occurred in England and Wales .\nWhether the deceased died in hospital , a care home or in the community , once registration is complete the ONS add it to their statistics .\nFor weekly statistics the ONS week runs from Saturday to Friday and the statistics are released 11 days after the week ending date .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small number of more complex cases .\nHowever , all are eventually resolved and the ONS record the registration of the death in the week it was notified .\nThe ONS also release mortality statistics on a monthly , quarterly and annual basis for comparison .\nThis does not suit a hungry MSM eager to sensationalise reported COVID 19 deaths .\nNor does it serve the immediate interests of State officials who want the public to accept their own house arrest .\nConsequently the MSM have reported COVID 19 mortality statistics from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NHS , some from the Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) and eventually the ONS .\nNow the Care Quality Commission have also been thrown into the mix .\nUltimately , all of these deaths will be registered .\nThe ONS will record them and it will be possible to know how many died , the causes of death and the trends identified .\nExcept in the case of COVID 19 .\nThe Coronavirus Act 2020 received Royal assent on March 25th .\nThis had significant implications for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONS data in relation to COVID 19 .\nNot only did the act indemnify all NHS doctors against any claims of negligence during the lockdown , it also removed the need for a jury led inquest .\nEffectively , only in the case of death from the notifiable disease of COVID 19 .\nWorrying as these elements of the legislation are , they are just part of a raft of changes singling out registered COVID 19 deaths as unusually imprecise .\nThe NHS issued guidance to assist doctors to comply with the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCCD .\nThere is no need for the scrutiny of a second Medical Examiner .\nThe Medical Examiner , or any other doctor , can sign the MCCD alone .\nThe safeguards introduced in 2016 were removed , but only in the case of COVID 19 .\nDoctors do not necessarily need to have examined the deceased prior to signing the MCCD .\nIf it is considered impractical for the doctor who last saw the deceased to complete the MCCD , providing they report that the deceased probably had COVID 19 , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate as a COVID 19 death .\nThere is no requirement for any signing doctor to have even seen the deceased prior to issuing the MCCD .\nA video link consultation within the 4 week period leading up to the patient \u2019 s death , is deemed sufficient for them to pronounce death from COVID 19 .\nIf that were not tenuous enough , as longs as the signing doctor believes the death was from COVID 19 , potentially absent any examination at all , perhaps simply by reviewing the patients case notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID 19 death can still be registered .\nThe coroner \u2019 s agreement is practically a fait accomplis .\nOn the 26th March the UK State released guidance from the Chief Coroner .\nThis was intended as advice to all coroners in cases of COVID 19 referral .\nThere were some notable changes to normal coronal procedures .\nParagraph 5 strongly reminded coroners of their obligation to maintain judicial conduct .\nIt stated : \u201c The Chief Coroner can not envisage a situation in the current pandemic where a coroner should be engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any public statements to the press.\n\u201d This thinly veiled threat to coroners made it clear that speaking out about any concerns would be considered a breech of judicial conduct .\nA career ending act it would seem .\nThe NHS guidance advised that if no signing doctor has seen the deceased prior to registration of death , a referral to the coroner must be made .\nThis is a procedural recommendation not a legal requirement .\nA legal requirement is only applicable in cases of unknown or suspicious causes of death .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s guidance states : \u201c COVID-19 is a naturally occurring disease and therefore is capable of being a natural cause of death\u2026\u2026The aim of the system should be that every death from COVID-19 which does not in law require referral to the coroner should be dealt with via the MCCD process.\n\u201d The Coronavirus Act 2020 also meant that a qualified informant , who agrees the cause of death on the MCCD , no longer needed to be anyone acquainted with the deceased .\nA hospital official , someone who is \u2018 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral director can perform this vital function .\nThe Chief Coroner advised : \u201c For registration : where next of kin/informant are following self-isolation procedures , the arrangement for relatives ( etc ) should be for an alternative informant who has not been in contact with the patient to collect the MCCD and deliver to the registrar for registration purposes .\nThe provisions in the Coronavirus Act will enable this to be done electronically as directed by the Registrar General.\n\u201d Most relatives , or someone acquainted with the deceased , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certainly be terrified of contracting COVID 19 because they have just been told their loved one or friend died from it .\nFurthermore , the Coronavirus Act has effectively placed them under house arrest .\nIn other words , if the MCCD signing doctor hasn \u2019 t seen the patient , while they were alive , no further inquiry is necessary .\nThe qualified informant can be someone who has neither met the deceased nor knows anything about the circumstances surrounding their death .\nIn this situation , but only for COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume the death was from the disease .\nIf you , the coroner , don \u2019 t like the idea , don \u2019 t make a fuss .\nJust sign the damn thing or else .\nThis quite bizarre death registration process compelled the ONS to issue guidance to doctors signing MCCD \u2019 s .\nNot only is there no need for an examination to pronounce death from COVID 19 , nor is there any necessity for a positive test or even an indicative CT scan .\nIn their guidance the ONS advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of death .\nWhen mortality statistics are used for research it is usually the most relevant factor .\nThe vast majority of COVID 19 deaths reported by the State and the MSM also reflect its identification as the underlying cause .\nThe World Health Organisation ( WHO ) define this as : \u201c The disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death.\n\u201d For COVID 19 , this determination can be based upon the clinical judgement of a doctor who has never met the deceased .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ video link consultation or a case note review of symptoms .\nThe problem is the symptoms of COVID 19 are largely indistinguishable from a range of other respiratory illnesses .\nA study from the University of Toronto found : \u201c The symptoms can vary , with some patients remaining asymptomatic , while others present with fever , cough , fatigue , and a host of other symptoms .\nThe symptoms may be similar to patients with influenza or the common cold.\n\u201d Nor is there any requirement for a post mortem to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Royal College of Pathologists states : \u201c If a death is believed to be due to confirmed COVID-19 infection , there is unlikely to be any need for a post-mortem examination to be conducted and the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death should be issued.\n\u201d Clear causation between the underlying cause and the direct cause is imperative to establish the fact .\nJust because someone tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 ( SC2 ) virus it doesn \u2019 t mean they developed the associated syndrome of COVID 19 .\nThe Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything between 5 % \u2013 80 % of people who tested positive for SC2 did not have any symptoms of COVID 19 .\nAsymptomatic people do not have a disease which impacts their health in the short term .\nEven for those who did test positive for SC2 , claims that this was the underlying cause of death are dubious in an unknown number of cases .\nFollowing the Coronavirus Act , in keeping with advice from the NHS , the ONS advised doctors : \u201c If before death the patient had symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test result has not been received , it would be satisfactory to give \u2018 COVID-19 \u2019 as the cause of death\u2026.In the circumstances of there being no swab , it is satisfactory to apply clinical judgement.\n\u201d This isn \u2019 t unique to COVID 19 .\nDoctors are required to complete MCCD \u2019 s \u201c to the best of their knowledge and belief \u201d even when test results may not yet be available .\nThe difference in the case of COVID 19 is that all the normal requirements for qualified confirmatory opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death have been removed .\nIn addition , the need to complete Cremation form 5 , requiring a second medical opinion , has been suspended for all COVID 19 deaths .\nGiven that post mortem confirmation is also extremely unlikely and agreement from a coroner is all but assured , this means possible COVID 19 decedents can be cremated without any clear evidence they ever had the disease .\nIn light of all the other registration oddities for determining COVID 19 mortality , the direct causation , proving COVID 19 was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful .\nWe just don \u2019 t know how many people have died from COVID 19 .\nWe are told many people have , but we can not state with any certainty what the numbers are .\nNeither can the ONS .\nObviously concerned about the implications , the Royal College of Pathologists ( RCPath ) have called for a systemic post outbreak review .\nThe Health Service Journal reports that the RCPath expects a detailed investigation into causes of death due to the degree of uncertainty .\nThe overwhelming majority of medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ONS statisticians and funeral directors have no desire to mislead anyone .\nHowever , in the case of COVID 19 deaths , the State has created a registration system so ambiguous it is virtually useless .\nThe statistical product recorded by the ONS , despite their best efforts , is correspondingly vacuous .\nThis hasn \u2019 t stopped the State and the MSM from reporting every death as proof of the deadliness of COVID 19 .\nClaims of COVID 19 as the underlying cause of death should be treated with considerable scepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the figures of COVID 19 deaths released by the NHS via the DHSC .\nThese were the numbers with positive test results .\nThe ONS also recorded positive test registrations from the NHS , care settings and the community .\nAs discussed , a positive test for SC2 doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean you suffered any health impact from COVID 19 .\nIn addition , the test itself has proved to have a varying degree of reliability .\nNonetheless , the ONS figures from all settings , were higher than those reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daily briefings .\nHowever , the reliance upon positive tests changed on March 29th .\nThe State instructed the ONS not only to record all registered COVID 19 deaths , where positive tests results were known , but also where COVID 19 was merely suspected .\nIn combination with the possibly spurious attribution from hospitals , this \u2018 mention \u2019 of COVID 19 , further distanced the statistics from clear , confirmed causes of death .\nThis prompted a significant increase in the COVID 19 fatalities reported by the ONS .\nNot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because the categorisation of COVID 19 deaths had changed .\nAny mention of COVID 19 anywhere on the death certificate , regardless of other comorbidities , such as heart failure or cancer , were now recorded as registered COVID 19 deaths by the ONS .\nThis addition of claimed COVID 19 deaths has punctuated the ONS data throughout the outbreak .\nWhile we are told by the MSM that these new figures better reflect the reality of COVID 19 mortality , in truth we are moving further away from any meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been altered at opportune moments to inflate and maintain the mortality statistics .\nJust after the virus peak of infection and the start of the lockdown , the State instructed the ONS to include suspected \u201c mentions \u201d of COVID 19 .\nAgain , as the recorded numbers of deaths were dropping , the State started releasing more figures from the care sector .\nFrom April 29th they have introduced additional figures provided by the Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) .\nIf the figures from the NHS are at best questionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of moving us into fantasy land .\nAll the same problems of decedents not being seen , video consultations , lack of corroborative medical opinion and so forth remain .\nHowever , in care settings the onus for signing MCCD \u2019 s shifts from hospital doctors to General Practitioners ( GP \u2019 s ) .\nThe CQC is the independent regulator of health and social care in England .\nDuring the COVID 19 outbreak it has not required care homes or community care providers to notify them of suspected cases .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the 29th April the CQC will provide statistics to the ONS where a \u201c care home provider has stated COVID-19 as a suspected or confirmed cause of death.\n\u201d This notification is made online via the CQC \u2019 s Provider Portal .\nProvisional figures will be included in the ONS daily updates .\nThe CQC is tasked with making sure decedents from care homes who died in hospital are removed from the reports before submitting them to the ONS .\nOtherwise massive duplication will occur .\nWe can only hope statisticians will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported what these statistics from the CQC will be based upon .\nFrankly , it makes jaw dropping reading .\nThe ONS state : \u201c The inclusion of a death in the published figures as being the result of COVID-19 is based on the statement of the care home provider , which may or may not correspond to a medical diagnosis or test result , or be reflected in the death certification.\n\u201d Most care home providers are not medically trained .\nTheir judgement regarding whether or not the decedent had COVID 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once weekly phone call with a GP .\nGuidance to GP \u2019 s from NHS England states that Possible COVID 19 patients should be identified primarily by weekly check-ins online .\nThis is in keeping with the NHS Key Principles of General Practice , in relation to COVID 19 , which states : \u201c Remote consultations should be used when possible .\nConsider the use of video consultations when appropriate.\n\u201d \u201c There is no validation built into the quality of data on collection .\nFields may be left blank or may contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be resolved at the point of publication .\nMost pertinent to this release are place of death and whether the death was as a result of confirmed or suspected coronavirus.\n\u201d This is the system the CQC will use to collect the data for the ONS reports .\nOnce someone , either in a care home or cared for in the community , is assumed to have died of COVID 19 , based upon the best guess of the care provider following a chat with a local GP , in keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their MCCD will be signed off as a COVID 19 death .\nThe ONS will add their death to the COVID 19 statistics and the State and the MSM will report them to the public as confirmed COVID 19 mortality .\nHow anyone can consider the statistics from care providers an accurate and reliable record of COVID 19 deaths is difficult to envisage .\nNonetheless , that is what we are asked to believe .\nAll we are able to identify with any certainty are the total number of of all deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ONS .\nWe can not be confident about what caused those deaths during the COVID 19 outbreak .\nThe State has presided over a truly remarkable bastardisation of the ONS data for COVID 19 .\nThis has not only rendered records of COVID 19 deaths a statistical black hole but , during the claimed pandemic , has also made the ONS data for other causes of excess mortality practically unknowable .\nEspecially for the ONS , any chance of accurately separating COVID 19 deaths from other causes of mortality has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in their history the ONS are reporting a relatively large number of highly dubious registered causes of death .\nHowever , they remain our best hope of knowing how many people have passed away .\nIn the meantime , while we wait for the ONS data to emerge , the MSM are reporting every COVID 19 death from any source they can find .\nSome are vaguely confirmed and some not .\nThey are also reporting suspected COVID 19 deaths from care homes , provisional figures from the NHS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again from the DHSC and later the ONS .\nThe narrative they are presenting , on the back of this hodgepodge of statistical irrelevance , is designed to convince the public of the severity of the outbreak in the UK .\nThere is clearly high excess mortality at the moment .\nThanks to the lockdown , this is happening while the NHS is essentially closed to everyone other than suspected COVID 19 patients .\nEarly studies have already predicted a significant health impact from the lack of essential health care caused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of other potentially fatal conditions aren \u2019 t getting it .\nThis was acknowledged by the UK \u2019 s Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty in the daily briefing on April 30th : \u201c \u2026You have the direct deaths from coronavirus but also indirect deaths .\nPart of which is caused by the NHS and public health services not being able to do what they normally can to look after people with other conditions\u2026.It is therefore important\u2026..to do the other important things like urgent cancer care , elective surgery and all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep people healthy.\n\u201d We just don \u2019 t know and the ONS have no way of finding out .\nHowever we do know , thanks to the ONS , the total all cause mortality as a percentage of population in England and Wales over recent decades .\nThis analysis shows us , while excess mortality this year is high , it is by no means unprecedented .\nIn fact , as a percentage of population , it is notably lower to the comparable years of 1995 , 1996 , 1998 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessitated the shut down of the economy nor the dire health consequences of closing the NHS to all but a few patients .\nBetween 27th March and 17th April ( ONS weeks 14,15 & 16 ) the ONS registered 25,932 additional deaths above the statistical recent 5 year norm .\nOf these 11,427 recorded COVID 19 as the sole mentioned underlying cause .\nWe have just explored the considerable doubt about this attribution .\nHowever , if we accept this figure , it means the remaining 14,505 people died with other registered underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of additional excess mortality is attributable to something else , either in addition to or entirely separate from suggested COVID 19 .\nGiven this inexplicable Spring mortality it seems highly likely these are at least some of the indirect deaths the UK \u2019 s Chief Medical Officer spoke of .\nTo claim all these excess deaths are the result of COVID 19 , as the State and MSM persistently do , is without any justification whatsoever .\nIt is not possible to identify how many people have died as a direct result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths or the resultant statistics .\nThis is not the fault of medical practitioners or statisticians .\nIt is caused by a State response to a claimed pandemic which has rendered the most crucial processes , and the data gleaned from them , a statistical nonsense .\n*** Author Iain Davis is an independent researcher and short filmmaker and the author of the new book , A Dangerous Ideology

Closer Look At Coronavirus Testing", "content": "A remarkable story made headlines last week \u2014 a goat , a quail and a papaya tested positive for coronavirus .\nFollowing a request by the president of Tanzania to evaluate the country \u2019 s coronavirus test kits , state security services sent a series of non-human samples to the national health laboratory to be tested .\nThe samples \u2014 which included goat , quail and papaya , as well as inorganic substances such as motor oil \u2014 were labelled with human names and ages , while technicians at the lab were not told of the plot .\nAfter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , President John Magufuli said there was a \u201c dirty game \u201d playing out at the lab , and that the imported test kits were faulty and had \u201c technical errors \u201d .\nHe also questioned whether there was a possibility of bribes or sabotage taking place : Importantly , the president then expressed concern about false positive test results , saying that the some people are being told they are infected when they are not actually carrying the virus .\nThe lab \u2019 s director as well as its quality assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Health announced a 10-person committee to investigate operations at the lab \u2014 not only procedures for handling and processing samples , but also the test kits themselves .\nIn response , the Africa CDC , who provided the tests in conjunction with the Jack Ma Foundation , defended the tests , as did the World Health Organization .\nJack Ma , the richest man in China and the man behind Alibaba , has been on a mission to supply over 150 countries with medical supplies , including a shipment of 1.1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that instead of acknowledging a possible problem with test kits or procedures , MSM reporting on this story repeatedly mentions President Magafuli \u2019 s endorsement of a Madagascan tonic as a COVID-19 treatment , his wish for Tanzanians to \u201c pray away \u201d the virus , and Tanzania \u2019 s failures with respect to its coronavirus response .\nMainstream outlets tend not to mention that he has a PhD in chemistry , his comments about sabotage , or his concerns over faulty tests and false positive results .\nThis is not the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn Britain , tests produced under Public Health England ( PHE ) protocols were found to lack sufficient accuracy and were abandoned .\nSimilarly , in the United States , the CDC \u2019 s own tests were also found to be flawed .\nOther countries including the United States , Spain , Czech Republic , Slovakia , Turkey and India have all reported faulty or inaccurate tests from Chinese suppliers .\nObviously , bad tests means bad results .\nFalse negative test results return people who are actually infected with COVID-19 back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to enjoy their remaining freedom .\nIf the virus spreads and behaves as the MSM would have us believe , a small number of false negatives could spell disaster .\nFalse positive results are dangerous for another reason \u2014 they cause people to be diagnosed with COVID-19 when they don \u2019 t actually have it .\nConsidering those people and possibly their entire households may then be quarantined , this is not a good outcome .\nIt gets worse when you add in the possibility of all their contacts being traced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also possibly being isolated , based on bad test results .\nBear in mind that when large numbers of people are tested , a small percentage of false positives will falsely inflate case numbers , possibly giving the appearance of outbreaks occurring where there may be none .\nConsidering much of the world has been placed on lockdown and large chunks of the global economy held for ransom , we ought to have an exceptionally high degree of confidence in the tests being used to detect coronavirus .\nPreparation for extraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Calma/IAEA .\nSource : Wikicommons ) Unfortunately , taking a closer look at the details of the testing process does not inspire confidence .\nRather , it brings up a number of potential pitfalls , which , taken together cast a different light on the entire coronavirus crisis .\nThe following brief analysis by virus researcher David Crowe summarises his discoveries regarding the RT-PCR test , the main method being used to test people for COVID-19 .\nHis research points to what are potentially massive flaws , including : \u2022 the arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of test results \u2022 documented cases in which test subjects alternately test positive , then negative and then positive again on successive tests \u2022 the inability of the test to prove that a virus is functional or even present \u2022 the possibility of both false negative AND false positive results \u2022 variability in test procedures ( which portions of the virus are being sought , etc ) among dozens of different test kits \u2022 the possibility of the ultra-sensitive tests being contaminated .\nBefore we mortgage our freedom and the global economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be a prerequisite that their results are at least accurate \u2014 but neither the tests themselves nor the public health bureaucrats pushing them even attempt to claim total accuracy .\nSo , who will test the tests ?\nHow accurate would you like your test to be ?\nMore on this from David Crowe \u2019 s The Infectious Myth : A lot depends on the result of your COVID-19 test , whether it is positive , indicating infection or , big sigh of relief , negative , indicating that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing as \u201c the \u201d COVID-19 test ?\nIndeed there is not .\nThere are many and each is looking for different things and making different decisions about whether those things are present or not .\nThe Test is Not Binary It is important to understand that the COVID-19 test does not inherently have only two values .\nThe test uses multiple cycles of the PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction ) technology , with an arbitrary count of cycles being the boundary between positive and negative , usually interpreted as infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division arbitrary , but we know that it does not work that well because there are numerous published examples of people testing positive , then negative , then positive again , within a few days .\nThere is , so far , no explanation of this phenomenon amongst people who are unwilling to question the test technology , test implementation or viral theory , although manufacturers do obliquely refer to this problem in their technical documentation by admitting that false positives can be caused by \u201c non-specific signals in the assay \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tests , false-positive results may occur.\n\u201d Imagine a game dreamed up by Harry Potter and Lewis Carroll .\nIt is played in a field and the bounds are a circle that is not marked .\nIf someone yells \u201c out of bounds \u201d the referee goes to the centre with a curled-up flamingo and rotates it a number of times , a number chosen arbitrarily by the referee .\nSome choose 30 , and some choose other numbers up to 45 .\nAdditionally , different referees have flamingoes of different sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tightly than at other times .\nBut , if you are within the , say , 37 flamingo turns , you are safe , and if not , out of bounds .\nWelcome to the world of testing for the coronavirus .\nCoronavirus tests are performed by sophisticated machines with simple interfaces .\nProgram the parameters of the test , pop in the samples , and in a relatively short time , the results are displayed , sometimes as a graph , or other times as simply as \u201c Positive \u201d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut the process is not simple .\nFirst the RNA needs to be extracted from the sample , which will include a lot coming from your cells , from bacteria , or other sources , as well as possibly some from viral particles , all of which could possibly react with a later stage , causing a false positive .\nIt is also important at this step to eliminate non-RNA substances that could interfere with following steps .\nSecondly , the RNA needs to be converted into DNA , because PCR only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase , hence the moniker RT-PCR for the combination of RNA conversion followed by standard PCR .\nThe RNA to complementary DNA ( cDNA ) conversion process is quite inefficient .\nStephen Bustin , a professor at Anglia Ruskin university , and perhaps the world \u2019 s leading expert on quality control of RT-PCR , told me in a recent interview ( infectiousmyth.podbean.com/e/the-infectious-myth-stephen-bustin-on-challenges-with-rt-pcr ) that the amount of DNA obtained can vary widely , easily by a factor of 10 .\nSince the PCR cycle number is a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiencies at the RT step essentially invalidate the simple use of the PCR cycle number .\nTwo different test setups in two different labs , that both use the PCR cycle number 35 as a cutoff , may actually have the cutoff between negative and positive at wildly different places .\nFinally , the third step , pure PCR occurs .\nAs described above , this is repeated many times .\nOn each cycle the DNA is unrolled from the double helix into two strands , the portion of interest is duplicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may think this explanation is complicated .\nYes .\nIt is a complicated process .\nAnd although a fancy machine makes it simple to operate , it doesn \u2019 t mean that every machine , every lab and every operator gets comparable results .\nYour situation is even worse than the operators because you will likely just be told either \u201c Infected \u201d or \u201c Clear \u201d .\nThe NHS does not exert much control over the choice of COVID-19 test , allowing in-house validation of test kits ( http : //www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/guidance-and-sop-covid-19-virus-testingin-nhs-laboratories-v1.pdf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to insist that commercially available , rather than in-house tests be used ( www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/21/public-health-england-admits-coronavirus-tests-used-send-nhs ) .\nThe US Food and Drug Administration , on the other hand , requires at least a fa\u00e7ade of test approval through their Emergency Use Authorizations .\nI downloaded 33 of the test kit instructions , hopefully a representative sample , to try to see how the tests differed in what they were looking for , how long they were looking , and how they decided whether they had found it or not .\nI also scanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturers thought their tests were perfect or not .\nIf you are a true masochist , you can check my analysis at : https : //www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations For some tests in the FDA list , the number of PCR cycles to distinguish positive from negative is not specified , but for most , it is .\nIn general , the more PCR cycles , the more likely that a false positive will be obtained , and the fewer cycles , the more likely a false negative will be obtained .\nOne manufacturer each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 36 , 37 , 38 and 39 .\n40 cycles was most popular , chosen by 12 manufacturers , and two recommended 43 and 45 .\nThe MIQE ( Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative RT-PCR Experiments ) guidelines for operation and reporting of RT-PCR states that the use of 40 or more cycles is unwise ( academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/55/4/611/5631762 ) .\nBustin \u2019 s advice in my interview with him was that not more than 35 cycles be used .\nWith either 35 or less than 40 , the majority of COVID-19 RT-PCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing RT-PCR to its limits or beyond .\nWhat is Being Looked For ?\nThe RT-PCR tests look for only a tiny fraction of the COVID-19 genome .\nAnd different tests look for different tiny fractions .\nMost do not specify the size of the portions , but a test developed by Charit\u00e9 Berlin ( not on the FDA list ) looks for the RdRp and E genes , which amount to 213 bases out of about 30,000 for the entire genome , or less than one percent .\nOn the FDA list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N and S genes and portions of the ORF ( Open Reading Frame ) .\nWhat is most important to know is not what the function of these RNA segments is , but simply that the tests are looking for very different things .\nIt is as if we went looking for leopards with one person using spots as the guide , another the claws , another the teeth and another the eyes .\nWorse than differences in what they are looking for is the way of defining whether they have found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must be present for the test to be declared positive .\nOthers look for two portions and both must be positive , while others only require one of the two to be positive .\nSome tests look for three portions , and generally only require two to be detected , although one test requires all three .\nThis is worth thinking about .\nA test that looks for three portions of the genome is generally happy if two are found .\nThat means that we can have a leopard without spots as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth .\nOr spots and teeth , but different claws .\nWhat does it mean to have a genome of a very simple creature like a virus , for which any part can be missing , but we still say it is what we are looking for ?\nAnd if we only have 1 % of an animal , is it possible we will decide it is a leopard when it is actually an ocelot ?\nEach test comes with a list of limitations .\nAnd the majority probably apply to all tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some .\nThese include noting that the test is only looking for RNA , and does not prove that a virus is present , and certainly can not prove that the virus is functional .\nSome note that RNA from the virus may persist after the infection has been resolved .\nA variety of reasons for false negatives and false positives are given .\nWhile public health agencies are generally not interested in false positives , this problem has the power to magnify the epidemic , as well as turning people \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note correctly that false positives increase as the number of actual infections in the population being tested decrease .\nAlso , RT-PCR is so ultra-sensitive , that a tiny amount of contamination at any stage of the process can result in a false positive , and the manufacturers warn about this .\nSome tests indicate that other coronaviruses may cause positive test results , but many coronaviruses are not believed to be very pathogenic , so this is equivalent to a false positive to the person receiving the misleading result .\nA mix-up @ @ @ @ @ @

"21stcenturywire", "title": "Washington State: Residents Who Refuse COVID Test to Be Placed Under House Arrest", "content": "As many US states struggle to roll-back their highly damaging lockdown policies , various complex technocratic \u2018 gating \u2019 systems are now being devised by public health officials \u2013 all of them presumable designed to prevent a theoretical \u201c second wave \u201d of coronavirus infections and deaths .\nOne such precondition is the call for \u201c mass testing and contact tracing \u201d for COVID-19 .\nThis is being proposed as a requirement for the lifting lockdown restrictions , supposedly until a vaccine or effective treatments arrive which are meant to rescue the public from the alleged unprecedented global pandemic .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system of medical martial law really means in terms of basic rights and civil liberties .\nThis issue may be coming to a head now .\nDuring a recent press conference on May 12th , Washington State Governor Jay Inslee revealed his radical agenda for rolling out his statewide contact tracing program , saying that his initiative \u201c is robust , it is vigorous and it is comprehensive , and it needs to be all three to be successful , \u201d Inslee said .\n\u201c If we do not succeed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus could come bright back and bite us.\n\u201d Again , Inslee is predicating his entire state strategy on the theory of a \u201c second wave \u201d of coronavirus ravaging the population if lockdown is lifted .\nHowever , this theory has been widely contested by other countries and epidemiological experts .\nThe other practical consideration is what good will mass testing do when it \u2019 s now well known that the overwhelming majority of COVID-19 victims are above the age of 75 with multiple comorbidities , and that most carriers in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require any medical care after being infected with the virus .\nWhat is the point of tracking , tracing and quarantining the healthy in large numbers if the virus poses no significant threat to the wider population ?\nInslee \u2019 s aggressive approach medical surveillance is similar to that of California governor Gavin Newsom \u2019 s 20,000 strong \u201c Army of Contact Tracers \u201c , and also echos calls by Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , who is advocating for large-scale contact tracing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nHow practical or necessary a mass contact tracing regime would be in order to contain a respiratory virus in its late stages \u2013 remains highly debatable : \u201c At the very beginning of a pandemic , the best way to stop it is to track down all the contacts of the initial , indicator cases , \u201d said Dr. Bettina Fries , chief of the infectious diseases division at Stony Brook Medicine .\n\u201c That approach doesn \u2019 t work anymore when the genie is out of the bottle and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would put too many resources to trace contacts .\nBy the time you have your contact , that contact has already generated many more contacts.\n\u201d At the press conference , Washington State health officials unveiled their medical surveillance master plan , the \u2018 Contact Tracing Box , \u2019 which very much mirrors system which has already been rolled out in countries like China : Things took a very dark turn when a reporter asked the governor the following question : \u201c We will have attached to the families a family support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what they need on a daily basis \u2026 and help them .\nIf they can \u2019 t get a friend to do their grocery shopping , we will help get them groceries in some fashion .\nIf they need pharmaceuticals to be picked up , we will make sure they get their pharmaceuticals [ \u2026 ] That \u2019 s going to help encourage them to maintain their isolation too .\n\u201c As far as refusal , it just shouldn \u2019 t come to that , and it really hasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success when we ask people to isolate , and they \u2019 ve done so in really high percentages , so we \u2019 re happy about that , and we believe that will continue.\n\u201d The implications of this statement are clear : if you refuse the State \u2019 s COVID test , then you will be placed under indefinite house arrest , and be assigned a State Minder to who will effectively be acting as a personal prison guard .\nThis unprecedented level of medical surveillance and authoritarianism raises the specter of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draconian measures to force its citizens to accept a mandated vaccine for COVID-19 .\nInvestigative journalist John Rappaport explains how deeply enmeshed Governor Inslee is with the Gates Foundation global vaccine network and why this issue may be coming quickly over the horizon : \u201c The first thing to know about Governor Jay Inslee : under President Bill Clinton , he served as a regional director for the US Dept .\nof Health and Human Services .\nHHS is in charge of the CDC .\nInslee is , therefore , actually a PUBLIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor of WA , he \u2019 s already on the team of Fauci and Birx clones who have staged state coups and are usurping and destroying human rights , including the right to make a living .\nWhen Inslee ran for a seat in the US Congress , in 2009-10 , among his largest campaign donors were pharma companies .\nThen there is Inslee \u2019 s connection to Bill Gates , the dark prince of lockdowns , the man who wants to keep the global population in chains until his COVID vaccine arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine has begun in Seattle .\nThis March , Inslee signed a bill into law , giving Gates \u2019 pet project , charter schools , state-aid money .\nApparently , Bill himself is short on cash .\nDr. Mary Alice Heuschel , a Gates Foundation deputy director , was formerly chief of staff for Inslee.\n\u201d The problem with this inherent conflict of interest , is that Bill Gates has already announced publicly the many US states should remain in lockdown \u201c until we have a vaccine that we \u2019 ve gotten out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state governors are no longer independent and taking instructions from federal health official and NGOs like the Gates Foundation , while seized unprecedented dictatorial powers over their citizenry , then where can the electorate go for redress of grievances ?\nSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV", "author": "21wire", "url":

manner by use of threats or force .\nOver the course of the Covid-19 \u2018 crisis \u2019 , scientific advice to the UK Government has been co-ordinated by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( SAGE ) .\nSAGE is co-chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance ( the Government Chief Science Advisor ) and Professor Chris Whitty ( the Chief Medical Officer ) .\nWe have already seen how SAGE has used external advisors to help direct the medical and social response .\nBut the UK government also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus response relate to behaviour \u201d .\nDuring the 2009/10 \u2018 swine flu \u2019 pandemic , SAGE received advice from a subgroup called the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour and Communications ( SPI-B & C ) .\nThat group was reconvened on 13 February this year .\nThis time , its remit was limited to behaviour and it was renamed the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour , or SPI-B .\nSPI-B takes no part in discussion about which interventions are effective in dealing with the Covid-19 \u2018 pandemic \u2019 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with providing advice on how to \u2018 help \u2019 people to adhere to the interventions which government demands .\nBy the beginning of March , there had been three meetings of SPI-B to discuss specific topics requested by SAGE : the risk of public disorder ; the use of behavioural and social interventions ; and how to give guidance to people who are asked to self-isolate .\nOn 22 March , in preparation for a SAGE meeting to be held the following day , SPI-B published a document ( pdf , mirrored here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social distancing measures .\n\u201c What are the options for increasing adherence to the social distancing measures ?\n\u201d , it asks .\nIt considers the two social distancing measure seen to be most important at that time : general social distancing by everyone , and shielding of vulnerable people for at least 12 weeks .\nThere are nine \u201c broad ways \u201d of achieving behaviour change , they write : Education , Persuasion , Incentivisation , Coercion , Enablement , Training , Restriction , Environmental restructuring , and Modelling .\nThe advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened , \u201d they write .\n\u201c The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent , using hard-hitting emotional messaging.\n\u201d In other words , SPI-B recommended to SAGE that levels of fear needed to be increased in order to bring levels of compliance with so-called \u2018 lockdown \u2019 up to desirable levels .\n\u201c To be effective , \u201d they continue , \u201c this must also empower people by making clear the actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Here , SPI-B is making it clear that it can \u2019 t be left to individuals to decide which actions are appropriate ; they have to be told .\nAnother option for managing behaviour which SPI-B recommends is the harnessing of \u201c social disapproval \u201d .\n\u201c Social disapproval from one \u2019 s community , \u201d they write , \u201c can play an important role in preventing anti-social behaviour or discouraging failure to enact pro-social behaviour .\nHowever , this needs to be carefully managed to avoid victimisation , scapegoating and misdirected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clear messaging and promotion of strong collective identity .\nConsideration should be given to use of social disapproval but with a strong caveat around unwanted negative consequences.\n\u201d There is a recognition here that following this approach could result in physical harm to individuals in a community who aren \u2019 t following the same behaviours as the community as a whole .\nBut it should be recognised that in order to make use of disapproval , government has to get into the community in question to stir up that disapproval .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a new technique to the UK government .\nDuring the Foot and Mouth Disease \u2018 epidemic \u2019 in 2001 , when the UK government slaughtered millions of farm animals unnecessarily , it made sure to minimise any organised community opposition to the \u201c slaughtered on suspicion \u201d policy by only compensating some of the farmers in any community .\nThis resulted in bitterness and envy within communities , and did permanent damage .\nVarious government ministers have expressed the view that a free media is essential .\nA question which immediately springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ?\nIn this case , what ministers evidently mean is freedom to act as a conduit for government propaganda .\nIn an appendix to their main recommendation , SPI-B produced a table which they entitled APEASE ( Acceptability , Practicability , Effectiveness , Affordability , Spill-over effects , Equity ) .\nThey describe it as an \u201c evaluation grid for options to rapidly increase general social distancing.\n\u201d Here , they make clear how they see the role of the media : not to hold government to account , but to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 message ( propaganda ) .\nThey recommend that the media is used : \u2022 to increase sense of responsibility to others Everyone following mainstream media since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak must surely have noticed the inflammatory language used in the mainstream press , which can have only increased the sense of personal threat felt by the general public .\nArticles from the BBC , such as To snitch or not to snitch \u2014 a discussion on the pros and cons of reporting your neighbour for breaking Covid-19 guidelines \u2014 fulfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility to others \u201d , otherwise known as \u2018 social disapproval \u2019 .\nIt is clear , therefore , that this SAGE advice has been taken .\nWhy would the media cooperate in this way ?\nIt was announced on 17 April this year that the Government and the newspaper industry have formed a three-month advertising partnership called All in , all together to help \u201c keep the public safe and the nation united \u201d throughout the Covid-19 \u2018 pandemic \u2019 .\nSo news media have a commercial interest in providing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , it has been noticed that the government is becoming the UK media \u2019 s most important client .\nThe SPI-B report was \u201c drafted by two members of the SPI-B panel and nine further members commented , following which the report was revised.\n\u201d They offer a caveat to that : As a result of this level of work , the population of the UK has been kept in their homes and the whole of UK industry has been shut down , resulting in the worst economic decline in 300 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this can be viewed as anything other than a direct psychological attack on the UK

2006 Origins of the Lockdown Policy", "content": "EDITOR \u2019 S NOTE : Regarding the findings below , it \u2019 s important to note that the Gilead Sciences who developed the controversial drug Tamiflu and licensed it to Roche Pharmaceuticals \u2013 was previously headed by President Bush \u2019 s Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , who owned substantial shares in the drugs firm alongside former U.S. Secretary of State , George Schultz , both of who profited from US and its allies stockpiling the drug ahead of the 2005 H1N5 Avian Flu and 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu outbreaks .\nNow begins the grand effort , on display in thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow to normalize the lockdown and all its destruction of the last two months .\nWe didn \u2019 t lock down almost the entire country in 1968/69 , 1957 , or 1949-1952 , or even during 1918 .\nBut in a terrifying few days in March 2020 , it happened to all of us , causing an avalanche of social , cultural , and economic destruction that will ring through the ages .\nThere was nothing normal about it all .\nWe \u2019 ll be trying to figure out what happened to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary plan to preserve hospital capacity turn into two-to-three months of near-universal house arrest that ended up causing worker furloughs at 256 hospitals , a stoppage of international travel , a 40 % job loss among people earning less than $ 40K per year , devastation of every economic sector , mass confusion and demoralization , a complete ignoring of all fundamental rights and liberties , not to mention the mass confiscation of private property with forced closures of millions of businesses ?\nWhatever the answer , it \u2019 s got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly surprising is just how recent the theory behind lockdown and forced distancing actually is .\nSo far as anyone can tell , the intellectual machinery that made this mess was invented 14 years ago , and not by epidemiologists but by computer-simulation modelers .\nIt was adopted not by experienced doctors \u2013 they warned ferociously against it \u2013 but by politicians .\nLet \u2019 s start with the phrase social distancing , which has mutated into forced human separation .\nThe first I had heard it was in the 2011 movie Contagion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times was February 12 , 2006 : Maybe you don \u2019 t remember that the avian flu of 2006 didn \u2019 t amount to much .\nIt \u2019 s true , despite all the extreme warnings about its lethality , H5N1 didn \u2019 t turn into much at all .\nWhat it did do , however , was send the existing president , George W. Bush , to the library to read about the 1918 flu and its catastrophic results .\nHe asked for some experts to submit some plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real thing comes along .\nThe New York Times ( April 22 , 2020 ) tells the story from there : Fourteen years ago , two federal government doctors , Richard Hatchett and Carter Mecher , met with a colleague at a burger joint in suburban Washington for a final review of a proposal they knew would be treated like a pi\u00f1ata : telling Americans to stay home from work and school the next time the country was hit by a deadly pandemic .\nWhen they presented their plan not long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree of ridicule by senior officials , who like others in the United States had grown accustomed to relying on the pharmaceutical industry , with its ever-growing array of new treatments , to confront evolving health challenges .\nDrs .\nHatchett and Mecher were proposing instead that Americans in some places might have to turn back to an approach , self-isolation , first widely employed in the Middle Ages .\nHow that idea \u2014 born out of a request by President George W. Bush to ensure the nation was better prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the national playbook for responding to a pandemic is one of the untold stories of the coronavirus crisis .\nIt required the key proponents \u2014 Dr. Mecher , a Department of Veterans Affairs physician , and Dr. Hatchett , an oncologist turned White House adviser \u2014 to overcome intense initial opposition .\nNotice that in the course of this planning , neither legal nor economic experts were brought in to consult and advise .\nInstead it fell to Mecher ( formerly of Chicago and an intensive care doctor with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oncologist Hatchett .\nBut what is this mention of the high-school daughter of 14 ?\nHer name is Laura M. Glass , and she recently declined to be interviewed when the Albuquerque Journal did a deep dive of this history .\nLaura \u2019 s name appears on the foundational paper arguing for lockdowns and forced human separation .\nThat paper is Targeted Social Distancing Designs for Pandemic Influenza ( 2006 ) .\nIt set out a model for forced separation and applied it with good results backwards in time to 1957 .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts to a totalitarian lockdown , all stated very matter-of-factly .\nIn other words , it was a high-school science experiment that eventually became law of the land , and through a circuitous route propelled not by science but politics .\nThe primary author of this paper was Robert J .\nGlass , a complex-systems analyst with Sandia National Laboratories .\nHe had no medical training , much less an expertise in immunology or epidemiology .\nThat explains why Dr. D.A .\nHenderson , \u201c who had been the leader of the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected the whole scheme .\nAIER \u2019 s Phil Magness got to work to find the literature responding to the 2006 paper by Robert and Sarah Glass and discovered the following manifesto : Disease Mitigation Measures in the Control of Pandemic Influenza .\nThe authors included D.A .\nHenderson , along with three professors from Johns Hopkins : infectious disease specialist Thomas V.Inglesby , epidemiologist Jennifer B. Nuzzo , and physician Tara O \u2019 Toole .\nTheir paper is a remarkably readable refutation of the entire lock-down model .\nThere are no historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement by quarantine of groups of possibly infected people for extended periods in order to slow the spread of influenza .\n\u2026 It is difficult to identify circumstances in the past half-century when large-scale quarantine has been effectively used in the control of any disease .\nThe negative consequences of large-scale quarantine are so extreme ( forced confinement of sick people with the well ; complete restriction of movement of large populations ; difficulty in getting critical supplies , medicines , and food to people inside the quarantine zone ) that this mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home quarantine also raises ethical questions .\nImplementation of home quarantine could result in healthy , uninfected people being placed at risk of infection from sick household members .\nPractices to reduce the chance of transmission ( hand-washing , maintaining a distance of 3 feet from infected people , etc . )\ncould be recommended , but a policy imposing home quarantine would preclude , for example , sending healthy children to stay with relatives when a family member becomes ill .\nSuch a policy would also be particularly hard on and dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the risk of infection would be heightened\u2026 .\nTravel restrictions , such as closing airports and screening travelers at borders , have historically been ineffective .\nThe World Health Organization Writing Group concluded that \u201c screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics .\n.\n.\nand will likely be even less effective in the modern era.\n\u201d \u2026 It is reasonable to assume that the economic costs of shutting down air or train travel would be very high , and the societal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train travel would be extreme .\n\u2026 During seasonal influenza epidemics , public events with an expected large attendance have sometimes been cancelled or postponed , the rationale being to decrease the number of contacts with those who might be contagious .\nThere are , however , no certain indications that these actions have had any definitive effect on the severity or duration of an epidemic .\nWere consideration to be given to doing this on a more extensive scale and for an extended period , questions immediately arise as to how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many social gatherings that involve close contacts among people , and this prohibition might include church services , athletic events , perhaps all meetings of more than 100 people .\nIt might mean closing theaters , restaurants , malls , large stores , and bars .\nImplementing such measures would have seriously disruptive consequences\u2026 Schools are often closed for 1\u20132 weeks early in the development of seasonal community outbreaks of influenza primarily because of high absentee rates , especially in elementary schools , and because of illness among teachers .\nThis would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to close schools for longer periods is not only impracticable but carries the possibility of a serious adverse outcome\u2026 .\nThus , cancelling or postponing large meetings would not be likely to have any significant effect on the development of the epidemic .\nWhile local concerns may result in the closure of particular events for logical reasons , a policy directing communitywide closure of public events seems inadvisable .\nQuarantine .\nAs experience shows , there is no basis for recommending quarantine either of groups or individuals .\nThe problems in implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of absenteeism and community disruption as well as possible adverse consequences , such as loss of public trust in government and stigmatization of quarantined people and groups , are likely to be considerable\u2026 .\nConfronting a manageable epidemic and turning it into a catastrophe : that seems like a good description of everything that has happened in the COVID-19 crisis of 2020 .\nThus did some of the most highly trained and experienced experts on epidemics warn with biting rhetoric against everything that the advocates of lockdown proposed .\nIt was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and showed no actual knowledge of viruses and disease mitigation .\nAgain , the idea was born of a high-school science experiment using agent-based modelling techniques having nothing at all to do with real life , real science , or real medicine .\nSo the question becomes : how did the extreme view prevail ?\nThe New York Times has the answer : [ Post-publication note : You can read the 2007 CDC paper here .\nIt is arguable that this paper did not favor full lockdown .\nI \u2019 ve spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards the 2007 plan as more liberal , and assures me that they never envisioned this level of lockdown : \u201c lockdowns and shelter-in-place were not part of the recommendations.\n\u201d To my mind , fleshing out the full relationship between this 2007 document and current policy requires a separate article . ]\nThe Times called one of the pro-lockdown researchers , Dr. Howard Markel , and asked what he thought of the lockdowns .\nHis answer : he is glad that his work was used to \u201c save lives \u201d but added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We always knew this would be applied in worst-case scenarios , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Even when you are working on dystopian concepts , you always hope it will never be used.\n\u201d Ideas have consequences , as they say .\nDream up an idea for a virus-controlling totalitarian society , one without an endgame and eschewing any experienced-based evidence that it would achieve the goal , and you might see it implemented someday .\nLockdown might be the new orthodoxy but that doesn \u2019 t make it medically sound or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that many great doctors and scholars in 2006 did their best to stop this nightmare from unfolding .\nTheir mighty paper should serve as a blueprint for dealing with the next pandemic .\nRead the paper below , Disease Mitigation Measures in the Control of Pandemic Influenza : *** Author Jeffrey A. Tucker is Editorial Director for the American Institute for Economic Research .\nHe is the author of many thousands of articles in the scholarly and popular press and eight books in 5 languages , most

bustling Barbican district in Plymouth , Devon , a veritable ghost town since UK lockdown began in March ( Photo @ 21WIRE ) A prominent Oxford epidemiologist has reportedly called for a more rapid exit from Britain \u2019 s lockdown , saying the coronavirus pandemic is \u201c on its way out \u201d of Britain after infecting as much as half the population .\nProfessor Sunetra Gupta says there would be a \u201c strong possibility \u201d that pubs , nightclubs and restaurants in Britain could reopen without serious risk from Covid-19 .\nThe professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely erred on the side of over-reaction in its handling of the crisis , suggesting imposing the lockdown itself was one such misstep .\nProf Gupta told unherd.com the Government had brought in the lockdown based on the worst-case scenario modelling of the Imperial College London .\nIn March , Imperial College \u2019 s workings suggested Covid-19 had a deaths-to-cases ratio of as high as 1.4 % , reducing to 0.66 % when allowing for undiagnosed cases .\nProf Gupta \u2019 s Oxford team produced a rival model , also in March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain \u2019 s population may have already been infected , and suggesting an infection fatality rate as low as 0.1 % , which she says would be far lower now .\nAsked for her updated ratio , Prof Gupta said the epidemic had \u201c largely come and is on its way out in this country \u201d and that the rate would be \u201c definitely less than one in 1000 and probably closer to one in 10,000 \u201d , or between 0.1 % and 0.01 % .\nProf Gupta said the Government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was based on a plausible , \u201c or at least a possible \u201d , worst case scenario .\n\u201c The question is , should we act on a possible worst case scenario , given the costs of lockdown ?\n\u201c It seems to me that given that the costs of lockdown are mounting , that case is becoming more and more fragile , \u201d she said .\nProf Gupta called for a \u201c more rapid exits from lockdown \u201d based on factors such as \u201c who is dying and what is happening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was feasible Britain could have fared better with the Covid-19 crisis by doing \u201c nothing at all \u201d or at least by concentrating on protecting the people most vulnerable to the disease .\n\u201c Remaining in a state of lockdown is extremely dangerous from the point of view of the vulnerability of the entire population to new pathogens , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Effectively we used to live in a state approximating lockdown 100 years ago , and that was what created the conditions for the Spanish Flu to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hard to prove on current evidence , Prof Gupta said there was a \u201c strong possibility \u201d the UK could return to normal without great risk .\n*** This story was originally published by the UK Press Association ( PA ) via Belfast Telegraph .\nSUPPORT OUR WORK BY

spreading the worst depression since the 1930s , the leaders of the premier globalization NGO , Davos World Economic Forum , have just unveiled the outlines of what we can expect next .\nThese people have decided to use this crisis as an opportunity .\nOn June 3 via their website , the Davos World Economic Forum ( WEF ) unveiled the outlines of their upcoming January 2021 forum .\nThey call it \u201c The Great Reset.\n\u201d It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coronavirus to advance a very specific agenda .\nNotably enough , that agenda dovetails perfectly with another specific agenda , namely the 2015

development , is huge .\nThat gives us a hint that this agenda is not quite about what WEF and partners claim .\nOn June 3 WEF chairman Klaus Schwab released a video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Great Reset .\nIt seems to be nothing less than promoting a global agenda of restructuring the world economy along very specific lines , not surprisingly much like that advocated by the IPCC , by Greta from

coronavirus and the ensuing collapse of the world industrial economy .\nThe WEF website states , \u201c There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the most urgent is COVID-19.\n\u201d So the Great Reset of the global economy flows from covid19 and the \u201c opportunity \u201d it presents .\nIn announcing the 2021 theme , WEF founder Schwab then said , cleverly shifting the agenda : \u201c We only have one planet and we know that climate change could be the next global disaster with even more dramatic consequences for humankind.\n\u201d The implication is that climate change is the underlying reason for the coronavirus pandemic catastrophe .\nTo underscore their green \u201c sustainable \u201d agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the would-be King of England , Prince Charles .\nReferring to the global covid19 catastrophe , the Prince of Wales says , \u201c If there is one critical lesson to learn from this crisis , it is that we need to put nature at the heart of how we operate .\nWe simply can \u2019 t waste more time.\n\u201d On board with Schwab and the Prince is the Secretary-General of the UN , Antonio Guterres .\nHe states , \u201c We must build more equal , inclusive and sustainable economies and societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pandemics , climate change and the many other global changes we face.\n\u201d Note his talk of \u201c sustainable economies and societies \u201d \u2014more on that later .\nThe new head of the IMF , Kristalina Georgieva , also endorsed The Great Reset .\nOther WEF resetters included Ma Jun , the chairman of the Green Finance Committee at the China Society for Finance and Banking and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the People \u2019 s Bank of China ; Bernard Looney , CEO of BP ; Ajay Banga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of Microsoft .\nMake no mistake , the Great Reset is no spur-of-the moment idea of Schwab and friends .\nThe WEF website states , \u201c COVID-19 lockdowns may be gradually easing , but anxiety about the world \u2019 s social and economic prospects is only intensifying .\nThere is good reason to worry : a sharp economic downturn has already begun , and we could be facing the worst depression since the 1930s .\nBut , while this outcome is likely , it is not unavoidable.\n\u201d The WEF sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies , from education to social contracts and working conditions .\nEvery country , from the United States to China , must participate , and every industry , from oil and gas to tech , must be transformed .\nIn short , we need a \u201c Great Reset \u201d of capitalism.\n\u201d This is big stuff .\nSchwab reveals more of the coming agenda : \u201c \u2026one silver lining of the pandemic is that it has shown how quickly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlmost instantly , the crisis forced businesses and individuals to abandon practices long claimed to be essential , from frequent air travel to working in an office.\n\u201d These are supposed to be silver linings ?\nHe suggests that those radical changes be extended : \u201c The Great Reset agenda would have three main components .\nThe first would steer the market toward fairer outcomes .\nTo this end , governments should improve coordination\u2026 and create the conditions for a \u201c stakeholder economy\u2026 \u201d It would include \u201c changes to wealth taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new rules governing intellectual property , trade , and competition.\n\u201d The second component of the Great Reset agenda would ensure that , \u201c investments advance shared goals , such as equality and sustainability.\n\u201d Here the WEF head states that the recent huge economic stimulus budgets from the EU , USA , China and elsewhere be used to create a new economy , \u201c more resilient , equitable , and sustainable in the long run .\nThis means , for example , building \u2018 green \u2019 urban infrastructure and creating incentives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) metrics.\n\u201d Finally the third leg of this Great Reset will be implementing one of Schwab \u2019 s pet projects , the Fourth Industrial Revolution : \u201c The third and final priority of a Great Reset agenda is to harness the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to support the public good , especially by addressing health and social challenges .\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis , companies , universities , and others have joined forces to develop diagnostics , therapeutics , and possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms for tracing infections ; and deliver telemedicine .\nImagine what could be possible if similar concerted efforts were made in every sector.\n\u201d The Fourth Industrial Revolution includes gene-editing biotech , 5G telecommunications , Artificial Intelligence and the like .\nIf we compare the details of the 2015 UN Agenda 2030 with the WEF Great Reset we find both dovetail very neatly .\nThe theme of Agenda2030 is a \u201c sustainable world \u201d which is defined as one with income equality , gender equality , vaccines for all under the WHO and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEPI ) which was launched in 2017 by the WEF along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nIn 2015 the UN issued a document , \u201c Transforming our world : the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\u201d The Obama Administration never submitted it to the Senate for ratification knowing it would fail .\nYet it is being advanced globally .\nIt includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals , extending an earlier Agenda21 .\nThe 17 include \u201c to end poverty and hunger , in all their forms and dimensions\u2026 to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption and production , sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change\u2026 \u201c It calls for sustainable economic growth , sustainable agriculture ( GMO ) , sustainable and modern energy ( wind , solar ) , sustainable cities , sustainable industrialization\u2026 The word sustainable is the key word .\nIf we dig deeper it is clear it is code-word for a reorganization of world wealth via means such as punitive carbon taxes that will dramatically reduce air and vehicle travel .\nThe less-developed world will not rise to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advanced civilizations must go down in their living standards to become \u201c sustainable.\n\u201d To understand the double-speak use of sustainable , we need to go back to Maurice Strong , a billionaire Canadian oilman and close friend of David Rockefeller , the man who played a central role back in the 1970s for the idea that man-made CO2 emissions were making the world unsustainable .\nStrong created the UN Environment Program , and in 1988 , the UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change ( IPCC ) to exclusively study manmade CO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isn \u2019 t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse ?\nIsn \u2019 t it our responsibility to bring that about ?\n\u201d At the Rio Earth Summit Strong that same year he added , \u201c Current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class \u2013 involving high meat intake , use of fossil fuels , appliances , air-conditioning , and suburban housing \u2013 are not sustainable.\n\u201d The decision to demonize CO2 , one of the most essential compounds to sustain all life , human and plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Lindzen an MIT atmospheric physicist puts it , \u201c CO2 for different people has different attractions .\nAfter all , what is it ?\n\u2013 it \u2019 s not a pollutant , it \u2019 s a product of every living creature \u2019 s breathing , it \u2019 s the product of all plant respiration , it is essential for plant life and photosynthesis , it \u2019 s a product of all industrial burning , it \u2019 s a product of driving \u2013 I mean , if you ever wanted a leverage point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this would be a dream .\nSo it has a kind of fundamental attractiveness to bureaucratic mentality.\n\u201d Lest we forget , the curiously well-timed New York pandemic exercise , Event 201 on October 18 , 2019 was co-sponsored by the World Economic Forum and the Gates Foundation .\nIt was based on the idea that , \u201d it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global\u2014a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences .\nA severe pandemic , which becomes \u201c Event 201 , \u201d would require reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and key international institutions.\n\u201d The Event201 Scenario posited , \u201c outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person , leading to a severe pandemic .\nThe pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS , but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.\n\u201d The declaration by the World Economic Forum to make a Great Reset is to all indications a thinly-veiled attempt to advance the Agenda 2030 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global \u201c Green New Deal \u201d in the wake of the covid19 pandemic measures .\nTheir close

"title": "Some Parallels Between CHAZ-CHOP and the US-backed Maidan Uprising", "content": "Following the explosion of protests and rioting following the death of George Floyd , \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d activists in Seattle proceeded to occupy seven city blocks with the blessing of he city \u2019 s Democratic mayor , fashioning it into a self-proclaimed Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone ( CHAZ ) , and later changed its name to Capitol Hill Organized Protest ( CHOP ) .\n\u201c This is not an autonomous zone .\nWe are not trying to secede from the United States , \u201d said one protester , Maurice Cola , recently in a video interview circulating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shot in the zone , one fatally , police were actually prevented by mobs from getting to the victims and denied access to the area in order to carry out a homicide investigation .\nWhere is this movement towards lawlessness headed , and what does it have in common with similar scenes in recent history ?\nIs this situation open to exploitation by power elites ?\nThe rate at which events are accelerating makes prediction a fool \u2019 s game .\nBut I \u2019 ll take a shot at it , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lot worse than \u2018 fool \u2019 in my life .\nSince the rioting began after the death of George Floyd it \u2019 s been obvious to anyone with any experience in covering global politics that these have been a directed operation aimed at undermining the presidency of Donald Trump here in the U.S .\nThe formation of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone ( CHAZ ) in downtown Seattle is the latest in a series of provocations and escalations intended to goad Trump into invoking the Insurrection Act of 1878 and deploying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly promoted by a complicit media in the West as mostly \u2018 peaceful protests.\n\u2019 They are anything but that .\nThis is a situation that , because of the subsidization of it by the Mayor , Jenny Durkan , and the Governor , Jay Inslee , that will persist just long enough to descend into violence and chaos .\nNote how I don \u2019 t use the word anarchy .\nBecause we \u2019 ve already seen a form of government form in the CHAZ , with a governing council , a constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying reparations to black members of the community .\nRaz Simone , like a latter day Issac Hayes \u2013 the Duke \u2014 from John Carpenter \u2019 s now prophetic Escape from New York , is passing out AR-15s and AK-47s to keep the peace of the gun .\nAnd in no time some pigs will become far more equal than others .\nBut , even if my worst predictions about the CHAZ do not come to pass , since it is very much a tactical operation in the grander strategy to undermine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be violence .\nAll we have to do is look at what happened in other so-called color revolutions that piggy-backed on legitimate protests against existing , corrupt governments .\nThis reminds me of the situation in Ukraine in 2014 where the protests on the Maidan plaza in Kiev turned violent when snipers began shooting from rooftops .\nAnd to this day there are questions as to who shot who and what actually happened .\nBut given that a peaceful stability in the CHAZ serves no one in power , on either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar provocation is very , very high .\nThe way I see this , the people in the CHAZ are pawns in a much larger game being played by the power elite many of them want to overthrow .\nAll it takes is one agent provocateur , one guy with a rifle and a narrative springs into being .\nIf there is one thing that is abundantly clear after four years of watching this escalation in the U.S. it is that there is nothing Trump \u2019 s enemies won \u2019 t do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , this is about far more than Trump .\nThis is about moving the U.S. into a failed political and economic state .\nThe economic destruction is already well underway thanks to the persistence of the COVID-19 insanity .\nThe new normal of face masks and social distancing highlight the sheer cowardice of the corporate managerial class and the complicity of the corporate leadership , as The Saker pointed out in a recent post .\nHe asks the question that if money isn \u2019 t the object of this corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at stake .\nThe answer , of course , is power : Specifically , the U.S. deep state \u2013 at a major faction within that deep state \u2013 is clearly desperate to get rid of Trump ( and *not* for the right reasons , of which there are plenty ) .\nThere are plenty of signs that illustrate that Trump is even losing control of the Executive , including Secretary Esper contradicting Trump on what is a key issue \u2013 restoring law and order \u2013 or the U.S .\nAmbassador to South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that these actions by top officials against their own Commander in Chief border on treason ) .\nNeedless to say , the pro-Dems neo-libs at Slate immediately began dreaming about , and calling for , a military revolt against Trump .\nAnd that new normal now separates Americans along yet another vector , one much subtler than wearing a MAGA hat or sporting a \u2018 Coexist \u2019 bumper sticker on their hybrid .\nAnd that \u2019 s exactly why I think there \u2019 s going to be some kind of Maidan-like event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refuse to take the bait and roll the tanks in , metaphorically , to break it up .\nBut , ultimately , this isn \u2019 t Trump \u2019 s job , it is the job of the local elected officials to provide services to protect the property and livelihoods of their constituents .\nBut that \u2019 s not what \u2019 s on display in Seattle .\nIt isn \u2019 t on display in New York City either where Mayor Bill DeBlasio is doing everything he can to disarm and delegitimize his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looters to run wild while enforcing social distancing rules against Hasidic Jews trying to worship in peace .\nThis is a movie whose ending I \u2019 ve seen before and I didn \u2019 t like it the previous times I watched it .\nWhat \u2019 s sad is that the people who \u2019 ve released this one are the same ones who released the previous ones .\nIt \u2019 s a tragedy which , frankly , as I \u2019 ve talked about ad nauseum .\nTrump has invited this onto himself because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while engaging in similar behavior against countries he doesn \u2019 t like \u2013 Syria , Lebanon , Iran , Iraq , Libya , Venezuela .\nNo one in the international community will shed one tear if Trump is deposed in November or during his second term .\nMany of us Americans recognize his faults and what they \u2019 ve wrought but still understand that the alternative to him is the restoration of the worst parts of the Empire .\nHis only true accomplishment to date has been staying in power in a White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of near irrelevancy .\nIf he doesn \u2019 t make substantive moves to neutralize those behind the CHAZ he will be the one blamed when it explodes .", "author": "21wire", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2020/06/23/some-parallels-between-chaz-chop-and-the-us-backed-maidan-uprising/", "published": "Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:15:00

payloads , and the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient \u2019 s own DNA .\nIf all goes well , the new genes instruct the cells to begin manufacturing powerful antibodies.\n\u201d The Times article taps Dr. David Baltimore for an opinion : \u201c Still , Dr. Baltimore says that he envisions that some people might be leery of a vaccination strategy that means altering their own DNA , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it \u2019 s a battle of the experts .\nThe two men Reuters cited , versus the Times \u2019 David Baltimore .\nI don \u2019 t hold up the scientific work of any of these men

"21stcenturywire", "title": "China vs India: Who Really Benefits?", "content": "A recent border dispute between China and India have resulted in multiple casualties including deaths .\nIt is the first time in decades that this scale of violence has been seen between the two nations .\nWestern headlines have immediately tried to play up the notion of conflict between China and India , but to what end ?\nChina and India respectively have the two largest populations .\nBoth find themselves within the top 5 largest economies on Earth .\nBoth have tremendous historical , cultural , and political influence regionally as well as growing influence globally .\nRecent headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and India \u2019 s borders , but at other times in recent years , Chinese and Indian cooperation have been on the rise \u2013 a fact conveniently under-reported in many articles .\nOf course , neither China nor India as nations benefit from armed conflict between one another .\nBoth nations possess large conventional armed forces and both nations possess nuclear weapons .\nBoth nations have suffered from the impact of COVID-19 economically .\nA large-scale conflict would be costly and catastrophic for China and India .\nChina has maintained that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border and claims it seeks to quickly deescalate tensions .\nChina \u2019 s CGTN in an article titled , \u201c China \u2019 s military urges India to stop provocative actions along border areas , \u201d would claim : Conversely , India \u2019 s media tells a different tale .\nThe violence has been immediately leaped upon by hawks to bolster entirely unrelated issues involving China \u2019 s \u201c challenge \u201d to the international \u201c status quo.\n\u201d It is a narrative that sounds torn straight from a Washington-based think tank \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article titled , \u201c Explained : What the clash in Ladakh underlines , and what India must do in face of the Chinese challenge , \u201d cites Indian politicians , explaining that the incident serves as impetus to create a wider confrontation with China in a bid to roll back not only its regional influence \u2013 but its growing global reach .\nThe issue regarding the South China Sea is one entirely manufactured out of Washington , with many of the actors involved \u2013 including the Philippines \u2013 having long since distanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of building better ties with Beijing .\nFor certain Indian politicians to cite Washington \u2019 s game in the South China Sea , and to then lump it in with this most recent border dispute \u2013 rather than simply seeking to deescalate tensions is highly suspicious .\nBritish state media \u2013 the BBC \u2013 in its article , \u201c India-China clash : An extraordinary escalation \u2018 with rocks and clubs \u2019 , \u201d would claim : The BBC fails to point out that China \u2019 s policies toward Taiwan , Hong Kong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all \u2013 without exception \u2013 owed to US meddling in China \u2019 s internal affairs .\nThe US which officially recognizes Taiwan as China \u2019 s territory has all but worked to carve it off from China and establish it as a US foothold on China \u2019 s doorstep .\nThe same can be said of Hong Kong with recent violence there openly sponsored by the US .\nAustralia \u2013 who counts China as its largest trading partner \u2013 and whose government is increasingly friendly with Beijing , has recently caved to US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China of unleashing COVID-19 \u2013 thus kicking off renewed tensions between the two nations .\nIf Indian politicians and diplomats see the recent border incident as \u201c related \u201d to US-driven conflicts aimed at encircling and containing China \u2013 does that mean this most recent border incident and the decidedly more aggressive reaction by some of India \u2019 s politicians falls into the same category ?\nChina and India have had border issues in the past .\nTotal war has been avoided and the conflicts have done little to change any significant aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global influence .\nIn other words , even if India felt it was losing out to China \u2019 s rise \u2013 using a border incident to start a wider conflict would harldy help India change this fact .\nFor India \u2013 seizing on this conflict regardless of who really initially provoked it \u2013 does nothing to serve India \u2019 s interests in the short , intermediate , or long-term .\nThey do \u2013 however \u2013 perfectly serve the interests of the United States who would prefer neither China nor India rise as regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal for both nations to destroy one another partially or entirely while the US reasserts itself across the region .\nProvocations and those attempting to exploit them may represent Washington \u2019 s best interests , but they do not represent India \u2019 s or China \u2019 s .\nThose involved are hawkish and decidedly pro-Washington serving US interests at India \u2019 s expense .\nMeanwhile , other Indian leaders and their Chinese counterparts have worked since the conflict arose to deescalate and resolve border issues \u2013 or at least resolve them to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEven the BBC , at the very end of its article , admitted that despite the illusion of imminent war \u2013 China and India have enjoyed growing ties , stating ( emphasis added ) : It is unlikely that the vast majority in both China and India benefiting from constructive ties between the two nations will give in to a tiny minority who ultimately serve the interests of neither nation and instead the interests of Washington far abroad , and away from the consequences of unchecked conflict .\nFor these reasons it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conflict is dangerous and both sides need to treat it with maximum caution and care , the fact that neither side benefits from the conflict unraveling out of control means it is very unlikely to do so .\nWhile the recent violence has been unseen in decades , it can be hoped that it is one of the last disputes between China and India that involves violence , and the last gasp of malign interests seeking to sabotage and set back both nations

over new coronavirus \u201c outbreaks \u201d seemingly popping up everywhere around the country .\nThis is naturally stoking more panic and fear , as well as calls to lockdown communities once again .\nIf you are looking closely , you \u2019 ll be able to read between the pedantic propaganda lines and quickly dispel a lot of the hype being promulgated by technocrats and other opportunists .\nTheir reporting usually follows a familiar pattern ; Step one : it starts off with a seemingly routine announcement like this , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have seen this gradual increase over the last several weeks , \u201d said Dr. Michael Johnson , Director of Community Health with the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\u201d Quickly , it becomes clear that the \u201c spike \u201d in COVID cases is because of increase testing : \u201c In addition to increased testing and increased cases , confirmed hospitalizations have had an overall increasing trend since May 31 , \u201d Caleb Cage said .\nFinally , they will sometimes reveal a crucial fact which is normally obscured from the conversation of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases \u201d : \u201c Despite the increase \u2013 the hospitals aren \u2019 t at a tipping point .\nStatewide hospital occupancy rates are averaging 74 % capacity for all patients .\nICU occupancy is averaging 69 % for all patients.\n\u201d From this very typical news report ( which you could drop into the same template almost anywhere around the US or UK right now ) , smart readers will see that these dramatic reports of \u2018 cases \u2019 do not mean much in terms of a general threat to public health .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inform the public one fundamental component which would quickly disarm any of these endless alarmist reports of COVID \u2018 outbreaks \u2019 \u2013 which is that all of these \u2018 cases \u2019 are not translating into the statistics which are actually important , namely , hospitalizations and deaths .\nThis is because the overwhelming majority of COVID fatalities have been in one specific demographic : elderly people with multiple comorbidities .\nIn fact , the odds of a young person actually being hospitalized for coronavirus are significantly less that getting in an automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of being set upon by influenza or numerous other common viruses .\nCOVID simply doesn \u2019 t rate among the most common things

states , more than 50 percent of all COVID deaths are occurring in these facilities .\nThe Times fails to mention deaths of the elderly at hospitals or , at home , cut off from family and friends .\nThe situation is far worse than the Times makes it out to be .\nHence , these type of graphs stoking fear over \u2018 cases \u2019 among the young are almost completely meaningless : This

mechanical [ breathing ] ventilation recorded a 97.2 percent mortality rate.\n\u201d Just in case all the other obvious factors failed to produce premature death in the elderly , ventilators provided the method .\nDon \u2019 t even think of saying , \u201c Well , you see , those old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and close to dying.\n\u201d NO medical treatment that kills 97.2 percent of patients in a

"Why Did Ghislaine Maxwell Leave Safety of France for Arrest in US?", "content": "IMAGE : The Great and the Good : Tycoon Jeffrey Epstein with Ghislaine Maxwell .\nIt \u2019 s the question which many are asking right now : why did this former colleague of notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein leave the relative safety of France , in effect , voluntarily allowing herself to be arrested in the United States ?\nOnce again , there is a lot more to this story than the mainstream media is letting on .\nAt a news conference on Thursday , acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York , Audrey Strauss , charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c sexual exploitation and abuse \u201d of multiple underage girls by Jeffrey Epstein , according to a court filing .\nStrauss also stated that Ghislaine Maxwell had \u201c repeatedly lied \u201d about her involvement in Epstein \u2019 s affairs , and that the truth was \u201c almost unspeakable.\n\u201d Indeed it was , most notably for Epstein himself , who mysteriousLy committed suicide whilst under the watchful eye of the federal prison system .\nStrauss added that British socialite Maxwell had \u201c enticed young girls , got them to trust her , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Epstein had set for them.\n\u201d She was arrested by the FBI Thursday at a luxury property located in Bradford , New Hampshire .\nMaxwell , 58 , and he daughter of newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell , has denied any wrongdoing and dismisses the claims against as \u201c absolute rubbish.\n\u201d Why Did She Leave France ?\nEver since Epstein \u2019 s untimely death in August last year , she has maintained a low public profile , effectively living \u2018 on the road \u2019 , jet-setting between properties in multiple countries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement .\nThe question remains why Maxwell would have suddenly handed herself over to US authorities now .\nThe answer to that question may very well have something to do with her friend Prince Andrew , who has been in a six-month standoff with the FBI who have wanted to interview him over his relations with Epstein and to answer to victims \u2019 accusations of under-age sexual abuse .\nCould Maxwell have been summoned by the powers that be in order to provide a buffer against any further overtures by authorities towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , the press have renewed their campaign pressure on 60 year-old Prince Andrew to \u2018 stop making excuses \u2019 and now tell the FBI everything he knows about Epstein and his former girlfriend and associate Ghislaine Maxwell .\nGloria Allred , a US lawyer based in Los Angeles who is representing 16 accusers of Epstein , has also publicly stated the Queen \u2019 s son must \u2018 contact the FBI immediately.\n\u2019 Maxwell , who was born in France to a French mother , has been hiding out in a luxury flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , located just a few minutes from Epstein \u2019 s former apartment on Avenue Foch , which was raided by French police in September 2019 .\nAs France does not extradite its citizens , it was believed that she was there in order to avoid being sent to the United States .\nHer move seems counter intuitive .\nWas she offered some kind of immunity deal through back channels ?\nWill the media \u2019 s legal spectacle create a sufficient distraction to protect some of Epstein \u2019 s high-profile friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there legal backroom maneuvers afoot ?\nOne possible clue is here , also reported today : Attorneys for alleged Jeffrey Epstein \u201c sex slave \u201d Virginia Roberts Giuffre were ordered Wednesday to destroy evidence from her case against Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 as lawyer Alan Dershowitz was also denied access to the potentially explosive information .\nManhattan federal Judge Loretta Preska said she was \u201c troubled \u201d to learn during oral arguments last week that Giuffre \u2019 s lawyers , from the firm of Cooper & Kirk , had been given sealed records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who Giuffre claims recruited her to have sex with Epstein and his pals while she was underage .\nThis means that some potentially incriminating evidence against Maxwell may now be removed from the picture , something that could strengthen her own defense and give her lawyers a stronger hand to play in their client denying any wrongdoing in the Epstein case .\nWhile her holding pattern in France was tenable , this did not mean that other pressures weren \u2019 t building in the background .\nAccording to Tatler Magazine : \u201c An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghislaine is moving locations every month to keep private investigators off her tail and is \u00adstaying at the residences of trusted colleagues and contacts .\nShe wants to remain in France for as long as she can to take advantage of extradition laws and has a huge network of contacts willing to keep her hidden .\n\u2018 Under French law anyone born on French soil is safe from extradition to another country , regardless of the alleged crime .\nIt doesn \u2019 t mean she won \u2019 t be \u00adprosecuted for her links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up facing charges it will be in France and not the US.\n\u2019 Maxwell was said to have been seen out in public on a number of occasions , wearing a scarf around her face to remain undetected .\nShe reportedly walked the streets of the upmarket part of Paris , near the glamorous Market restaurant and Le Berkeley and Le Bristol hotels .\nA local source was quoted as stating : \u2018 She was here just before France announced its coronavirus lockdown .\nShe rarely went out , but when she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pulled tightly around her face and draped across her shoulders .\nShe clearly didn \u2019 t want to be \u00adrecognised and was able to blend in .\nBut she was wearing her \u00addistinctive gold sovereign ring on her left hand and a larger , glitzier ring on her right.\n\u2019 There was another interesting detail in this report : \u201c Other sources reportedly claimed to have spotted Maxwell walking away from the Israeli Embassy.\n\u201d This detail is interesting because Maxwell is also the daughter of \u201c Israeli Super Spy \u201d Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that Tel Aviv could also have been a flight destination .\nTying these two details together is no mere conspiracy theory , rather , it is based on a series of inconvenient facts .\nHer links to Israeli intelligence also come into play with accusations that Jeffrey Epstein was involved in blackmailing political and business elites .\nCertainly , the prominent feature of Ghislaine as Epstein \u2019 s chief procurer of females for his harem \u2013 should raise a strong suspicion that this may indeed be the case .\nAdd to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were visible on the flight manifests of the Lolita Express to his private island of Little St. James \u2013 former Israeli PM Ehud Barack , alongside US President Bill Clinton , and others .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting here that it was President Clinton who secured an eleventh hour pardon of convicted criminal financier and Clinton associate Marc Rich .\nIn fact , it was former Mossad chief , Shabtai Shavit , who urged Clinton to pardon Rich .\nWas there any blackmail involved in that transaction ?\nPrevious to that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Clinton Inc : The Audacious Rebuilding of a Political Machine , where phone sex conversations between Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky were wiretapped ( circa 1997-98 ) and used as a blackmail against the White House by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .\nNetanyahu was using intercepted phone sex conversations between the president and Lewinsky to force the release of American Jonathan Pollard , who had been caught spying on behalf of the Israelis .\nClinton and Netanyahu \u2019 s desperate plea to release Pollard but was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenet .\nThe fact that large sums of money have been moving back and forth between Epstein and Maxwell indicates that they may have been involved in a number of highly illicit activities .\nFrom the recent Grand Jury discovery : In an article written for the Daily Beast , reporter Vickie Ward noted how when former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta cut Epstein his \u2018 sweetheart \u2019 plea deal back in 2007 , he had also been told to \u201c back off , that Epstein was above his pay grade.\n\u201d \u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 and to leave it alone , \u201d said Acosta , who was recently forced to resign as Trump \u2019 s Secretary of Labor .\nWard explained this potential game-changer here : Epstein \u2019 s name , I was told , had been raised by the Trump transition team when Alexander Acosta , the former U.S. attorney in Miami who \u2019 d infamously cut Epstein a non-prosecution plea deal back in 2007 , was being interviewed for the job of labor secretary .\nThe plea deal put a hard stop to a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minors and trafficking .\n\u201c Is the Epstein case going to cause a problem [ for confirmation hearings ] ?\n\u201d Acosta had been asked .\nAcosta had explained , breezily , apparently , that back in the day he \u2019 d had just one meeting on the Epstein case .\nHe \u2019 d cut the non-prosecution deal with one of Epstein \u2019 s attorneys because he had \u201c been told \u201d to back off , that Epstein was above his pay grade .\n\u201c I was told Epstein \u2018 belonged to intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he told his interviewers in the Trump transition , who evidently thought that was a sufficient answer and went ahead and hired Acosta .\n( The Labor Department had no comment when asked about this . )\nThe question then remains : which intelligence ?\nThe answer may be classified , so we may never know the full story .\nStill , we can expect more details to come to the fore through this process .", "author": "21wire", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2020/07/02/why-did-ghislaine-maxwell-leave-safety-of-france-for-arrest-in-us/", "published": "Thu, 02 Jul

admission , as evidenced by the Daily Beast emblazoning \u201c LIVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the top of its latest resistance piece .\nOver the last three weeks , the mainstream media backed by their pharmaceutical giants , have ramped-up their propaganda campaign claiming that there is a \u201c crippling surge of cases \u201d across the country.Official are raising the alarm because of reports that 55,000 new cases of coronavirus have been detected , as media continuing crowing that \u201c infection rates are hitting new records in multiple states.\n\u201d What they are not telling the public is that the US are also conducting a record number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which has been in increase in positive tests , or what the media like to refer to as \u201c cases , \u201d giving the false impression that it \u2019 s another outbreak of the plague .\nMoreover , the majority of these news cases are younger persons .\nIn reality , without any proper epidemiological context , the number \u2018 cases \u2019 is relatively meaningless , because it says nothing about the threat the public health .\nThe only two statistics which can indicate what is the true threat to public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be directly attributed to COVID-19 .\nThis is the data that matters .\nAny numbers outside of this are patently useless .\nThe reason why touting numbers of \u201c cases \u201d is useless is because they ignore the hard facts which the data returned has already show us : Age Demographics \u2013 The overwhelming majority of COVID fatalities have been in one specific demographic : elderly people with multiple comorbidities .\nIn fact , the odds of a young person actually being hospitalized for coronavirus are significantly less that getting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at greater risk of being set upon by influenza or numerous other common viruses .\nCOVID simply doesn \u2019 t rate among the most common illnesses which a pose a threat to young people , or even middle aged people for that matter .\nThe data from every country proves this .\nLocation \u2013 Proportionally , the majority of all COVID deaths in the US have occurred in a few major cities , and in one or two particular setting .\nIn cities like New York , Los Angeles , Detroit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities have been in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for the elderly : \u201c The New York Times ( June 27 ) is reporting that 43 percent of all US COVID deaths are occurring in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for the elderly .\nIn at least 24 states , more than 50 percent of all

from our previous encounters with coronaviruses .\nThis line of defense is especially effective in younger populations.Common sense .\nThis adaptive immunity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have acquired from

pharmaceutical industry and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nConclusion : In general , the vast majority global population has NEVER been at risk of hospitalization or death from COVID 19 , certainly not more than any other of the more common infectious diseases like Influenza , Malaria or Tuberculosis .\nWhile the coordinated response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major plague , the reality is that

"content": "Today , we are being told by multiple mainstream media outlets that resurgence of the Black Death is on the way .\nBut is this story really news worthy ?\nFear merchants in editorial rooms across the world seem very keen to promote the idea of a \u201c high alert \u201d situation in China \u2019 s Inner Mongolia region where it has been reported that one \u201c suspected case \u201d of Bubonic Plague was detected over the weekend .\nOf course , this has triggered a knee-jerk panic , as Chinese health officials are now telling the public to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed plague .\nIn a country of 1.5 billion , one single case is relatively meaningless in terms of a public health threat .\nNonetheless , many western governments are adopting the new Chinese model of bio-crisis management .\nOf course , this story may burn itself out in 24 hours , but it \u2019 s important to point out how indicative this is over the standard media operating procedure in the era of COVID .\nIn the northern China city of Bayan Nur , the government has since issued a level III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow prevention and control measures regarding the handling of wild animals .\nThey are being told this is to \u201c to prevent and control the plague.\n\u201d Also known historically as the \u201c Black Death , \u201d the Bubonic Plague is a bacterial disease normally spread by fleas living on wild rodents .\nIn the most extreme cases , without treatment , it can cause death in up to 60 percent of patients , according to the World Health Organization could even kill an adult in 24 hours .\nBut cases are extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for this infection , including various antibiotics .\nAlthough it \u2019 s been virtually eradicated in the developed world , it has appeared on the scene in recent years , but not beyond the odd case .\nCertainly , one single case in rural China is hardly reason to raise a pandemic alarm .\nAccording to Healthline , only a couple thousand cases are reported worldwide each year , most of which are located in Africa , India , and Peru , and also in the U.S. which records roughly seven cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Arizona , California , Colorado , New Mexico , and Texas .\nMore likely , this is the government-media complex and its pharmaceutical benefactors flexing their post-COVID muscles again .\nWe can expect more scares like this

.\nIn fact , they never really even began covering it .\nHence , there has been little or no real international response to the war crimes in Yemen being perpetrated by Saudi Arabia , UAE the United States and UK .\nThe deaths tolls , the humanitarian disaster numbers \u2013 have all been off the scale since the US and Saudi quietly declared war on Yemen in March 2015 .\nBy bombing the country

"content": "The tea leaves are beginning to turn out .\nThis may well be the year in which the climate change movement begins to go off the rails .\nIt started off great , as elites and climatists descended on Davos to press home what looked to be the final mile in ramming through the adoption of some form of global Green New Deal by year \u2019 s end .\nTheir secret weapon , a Swedish teen , was primed , locked and loaded .\nTheir cause was then handed another gift in the Coronavirus lockdowns .\nClimate campaigners were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boasted with claims of lower CO2 levels due the economic shutdown .\nIn just two months , COVID lockdown policies had achieved what climate campaigners had been working for years to realize .\nOr so they thought .\nIt was later revealed that lockdowns had little or no impact on overall CO2 concentration .\nBut since when did a little science get in the way of an apocalyptic juggernaut .\nBut something strange happened on the way to Wuhan .\nOne of the key components of the intergovernmental fear campaign to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nInitially , these were referred to as \u201c The Science \u201d by cock-sure politicians and public health officials .\nThe press quickly fell in line with this groupthink .\nAny dissenters were roundly attacked and deplatformed .\nAs their mission crept on , it became clear that these models were ever only masquerading as \u2018 science \u2019 .\nThe fictional doomsday scenarios being created by technocrats were then snapped up by the mainstream media , and then used them to hound political officials into implementing a one-size-fits-all centralized policy of de-industrialization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s no coincidence that this is exactly what climatists and Green New Deal campaigners have been hoping for .\nPrior to COVID , few dared to publicly challenge the intellectual primacy of computer modelling , especially in the field of climate science .\nSkeptics were simply told , \u201c Shut up !\nThey are experts !\n\u201d Only , it turns out the skeptics were right .\nIt was regarded as infallible , even though just like Neil Ferguson and Imperial College \u2019 s erroneous modelling of pandemics \u2013 these glorified SIM City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fall-out in both the UK and US over these wild computer-generated predictions that were used by governments to adopt lockdown policies has also exposed these crude devices as pseudo-science used to paint an unlikely Armageddon .\nNow , a scorned public is starting to question the assumed authority of computer modelling .\nPeople are beginning to look more cautiously at climate modellers from the IPCC , and serial data masseuses like Michael Mann \u2013 all of whom are being questioned with renewed skepticism .\nNo doubt , this will continue to erode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate dogma which has enjoyed its place on the throne of consensus reality ever since Al Gore released his now discredited documentary film An Inconvenient Truth in 2005 .\nAdding more insult to injury , this year also saw the release of Michael Moore \u2019 s documentary Planet of Humans which completely destroyed the the received green wisdom regarding stalwart solutions for \u2018 green \u2019 energy being touted by environmental activists over the last 30 years .\nFor their blasphemy , both Moore and director Jeff Gibbs were branded heretics by the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank on the green new gospel .\nThis incident was then followed by the release of the new book , Apocalypse Never : Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All , by green policy expert Michael Shellenberg .\nThe book quickly shot up to number # 3 top seller on Amazon and has since drawn fire from activists who claim that like Moore , the author has stabbed the climate movement in the back by revealing some of the trade secrets of green activism .\nBut Shellenberger is merely pointed out the obvious \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth mass extinction , \u201d that climate change is not making natural disasters worse , and that CO2 emissions are actually plateaued in most developed nations .\nFor this , he has been mercilessly attacked by climate clerics .\nAnd that brings us back to Generation X , Y , Z \u2019 s ( and liberal Boomers too ) latter day Joan of Arch , the mercurial Swede , Greta Thunberg .\nBefore coronavirus , her stock was riding high \u2013 halfway into a glorious gap year and transatlantic carbon-neutral sailing excursion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summit in Spain , and then on to the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , where she rubbed elbows with Charles , the Prince of Wales .\nAt Davos , it was clear that Greta \u2019 s physical appearance had changed .\nShe had lost a lot of weight in a very short space of time \u2013 a far cry from her jovial , bouncy self .\nThis was a new mini-adult , a darker and much more cynical Greta .\nClearly , the miles , the media , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd her disdain for the great and the good was manifest .\nWatch : From there , she would have been looking forward to a spring season meant to culminate in a series of youth \u2018 climate actions \u2019 spanning into summer , maybe an appearance at Glasonbury festival next to some super group , and then leading towards COP26 in Glasgow this November .\nThat was the plan .\nBut unfortunately , with the west \u2019 s student body all but grounded at home by a new more impressive Project Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of her legions of angry adolescents .\nNow donning masks and plastic visors , the youth have other more pressing issues to contend with ; omnipresent fears of the plague , school closures , oppressive social distancing regimes , and mass unemployment \u2013 all of which will trump fears that sea levels might rise a few meters in 200 years time .\nEven COP26 might end up being done on Zoom due to COVID concerns .\nGreta \u2019 s gravitas doesn \u2019 t translate as well in desktop avatar form .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcore climatists reading this , we \u2019 re sorry , that \u2019 s just where things are at now .\nBut Greta is very sharp customer , and will eventually cop on to the game .\nShe has already begun hitting out at slovenly world leaders \u2013 who she claims have been using her to \u201c look good.\n\u201d And she \u2019 s not wrong either .\nCertainly , turnabout is fair play , but we should point out that Greta was a minor through her mercurial rise to fame , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor Svante Thunberg and mother and opera singer Malena Ernman \u2013 who have allowed their daughter to be used as a glorified mascot for political parties , multiple globalist organizations , NGOs and corporate media consortiums .\nIn a recent interview on Swedish radio during the COVID crisis , she accused German chancellor , Angela Merkel , of using her for cheap \u201c selfie \u201d at a UN event in New York .\n\u201c Presidents , prime ministers , kings and princesses came and wanted to talk to me , \u201d said Greta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the chance that they could take a photo with me for their Instagram account .\nThen the hashtag # savetheplanet \u2026 They can post it on social media and it makes them look good , it makes them seem like they care.\n\u201d Her handlers should take heed : she \u2019 s getting more savvy .\nFor those who have actually followed her story , you will know that from day one , Greta Thunberg \u2019 s supposed \u2018 grassroots \u2019 rise was a well-financed and carefully choreographed public relations campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , security and a gaggle of support staff .\nAs time progresses , and as holes in the climate narrative begin to expand , it \u2019 s increasingly likely that Greta herself , now 17 years old , will realize the extent of the financialized operation in which she been used like a tool to wind-up and set in motion .\nAt that point , she will be a full-fledged adult , and thus harder to manage by her handlers working to ferry around selling the New Green Economy .\nSooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , and then forge her own path as a free-thinking adult .\nBy that time , the wheels may have already fallen off the climate change bandwagon .\nThe information berm has now burst .\nWith each passing month , you will see more green realists going off script .\nMore Moore \u2019 s , and more Shellenberger \u2019 s .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean it will stop .\nIf COVID showed us anything , it \u2019 s globalists organizations and their cadres in government are determined to advance their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth Industrial Revolution and UBI utopia .\nShades of Huxley \u2019 s Brave New World .\nThat \u2019 s no exaggeration .\nUS Presidential Election beckons , and there \u2019 s more at stake than ever .\nMany believe a Trump victory could set the climate change agenda back a further ten years .\nSo in terms of expediting this agenda , 2020 is really a do or die year .\n*** This OpEd

environmentalists everywhere , I \u2019 d like to formally apologise for the climate scare we created.\n\u201d On behalf of environmentalists everywhere , I would like to formally apologise for the climate scare we created over the past 30 years .\nClimate change is happening .\nIt \u2019 s just not the end of the world .\nIt \u2019 s not even our most serious environmental problem .\nI may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this .\nI have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the US congress to provide \u00adobjective testimony , and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to serve as a reviewer of its next assessment report , I feel an obligation to apologise for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public .\nHere are some facts few people know : \u25cf Humans are not causing a \u201c sixth mass extinction \u201d \u25cf The Amazon is not \u201c the lungs of the world \u201d \u25cf Climate change is not making natural disasters worse \u25cf Fires have declined 25 per cent around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land we use for meat \u2014 humankind \u2019 s biggest use of land \u2014 has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska \u25cf The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests , not climate change , explain why there are more , and more dangerous , fires in Australia and California \u25cf Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain , Germany and France since the mid-1970s \u25cf The Netherlands became rich , not poor , while adapting to life below sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter \u25cf Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change \u25cf Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels , and \u25cf Preventing future pandemics requires more , not less , \u201c industrial \u201d agriculture .\nI know the above facts will sound like \u201c climate denialism \u201d to many people .\nBut that just shows the power of climate alarmism .\nIn reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific studies , including those \u00adconducted by or accepted by the IPCC , the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations , the Inter\u00adnational Union for the Conservation of Nature and other leading scientific bodies .\nSome people will , when they read this , imagine that I \u2019 m some right-wing anti-environmentalist .\nI \u2019 m not .\nAt 17 , I lived in Nicaragua to show solidarity with the Sandinista socialist revolution .\nAt 23 I raised money for Guatemalan women \u2019 s co-operatives .\nIn my early 20s I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small farmers fighting land invasions .\nAt 26 I helped expose poor conditions at Nike factories in Asia .\nI became an environmentalist at 16 when I threw a fundraiser for Rainforest Action Network .\nAt 27 I helped save the last unprotected ancient redwoods in California .\nIn my 30s I advocated renewables and successfully helped persuade the Obama administration to \u00adinvest $ US90bn into them .\nOver the past few years I helped save enough nuclear plants from being replaced by fossil fuels to prevent a sharp increase in emissions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided speaking out against the climate scare .\nPartly that \u2019 s because I was embarrassed .\nAfter all , I am as guilty of alarmism as any other environmentalist .\nFor years , I \u00adreferred to climate change as an \u201c existential \u201d threat to human civilisation , and called it a \u201c crisis \u201d .\nThe author second from right in Brazil in 1985 ( Picture : Michael Shellenberger ) But mostly I was scared .\nI remained quiet about the climate disinformation campaign because I was afraid of losing friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned the courage to defend climate science from those who misrepresent it I suffered harsh consequences .\nAnd so I mostly stood by and did next to nothing as my fellow environmentalists terrified the public .\nI even stood by as people in the White House and many in the media tried to destroy the reputation and career of an outstanding scientist , good man , and friend of mine , Roger Pielke Jr , a lifelong progressive Democrat and environmentalist who testified in favour of carbon regulations .\nWhy did they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters aren \u2019 t getting worse .\nBut then , last year , things spiralled out of control .\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez said : \u201c The world is going to end in 12 years if we don \u2019 t address climate change.\n\u201d Britain \u2019 s most high-profile environmental group claimed \u201c climate change kills children \u201d .\nThe world \u2019 s most influential green journalist , Bill McKibben , called climate change the \u201c greatest challenge humans have ever faced \u201d and said it would \u201c wipe out civilisations \u201d .\nMainstream journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was \u201c the lungs of the world \u201d , and that deforestation was like a \u00adnuclear bomb going off .\nAs a result , half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity \u00adextinct .\nAnd in January , one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change .\nWhether or not you have children you must see how wrong this is .\nI admit I may be sensitive because I have a teenage daughter .\nAfter we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut her friends are deeply misinformed and thus , understandably , frightened .\nI thus decided I had to speak out .\nI knew that writing a few articles wouldn \u2019 t be enough .\nI needed a book to properly lay out all of the evidence .\nAnd so my formal \u00adapology for our fearmongering comes in the form of my new book , Apocalypse Never : Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All .\nIt is based on two decades of research and three decades of environmental activism .\nAt 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Apocalypse Never covers climate change , deforestation , plastic waste , species extinction , industrialisation , meat , nuclear energy , and renewables .\nSome highlights from the book : \u25cf Factories and modern farming are the keys to human liberation and environmental progress \u25cf The most important thing for saving the environment is producing more food , particularly meat , on less land \u25cf The most important thing for reducing pollution and emissions is moving from wood to coal to petrol to natural gas to uranium \u25cf 100 per cent renewables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy from today \u2019 s 0.5 per cent to 50 per cent \u25cf We should want cities , farms , and power plants to have higher , not lower , power densities \u25cf Vegetarianism reduces one \u2019 s emissions by less than 4 per cent \u25cf Greenpeace didn \u2019 t save the whales \u2014 switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did \u25cf \u201c Free-range \u201d beef would require 20 times more land and produce 300 per cent more emissions \u25cf Greenpeace dogmatism worsened forest fragmentation of the Amazon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Congo produced a backlash that may have resulted in the killing of 250 elephants .\nWhy were we all so misled ?\nIn the final three chapters of Apocalypse Never I expose the \u00adfinancial , political and ideological motivations .\nEnvironmental groups have accepted hundreds of millions of dollars from fossil fuel interests .\nGroups motivated by anti-humanist beliefs forced the World Bank to stop trying to end poverty and instead make poverty \u201c sustainable \u201d .\nAnd status anxiety , depression and hostility to modern civilisation are behind much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear myth has been a crucial meme in advancing climate change dogma .\nOnce you realise just how badly misinformed we have been , often by people with plainly unsavoury motivations , it is hard not to feel duped .\nWill Apocalypse Never make any difference ?\nThere are certainly reasons to doubt it .\nThe news media have been making apocalyptic pronouncements about climate change since the late 1980s , and do not seem disposed to stop .\nThe ideology behind environmental alarmism \u2014 Malthusianism \u2014 has been repeatedly debunked for 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever .\nBut there are also reasons to \u00adbelieve that environmental alarmism will , if not come to an end , have diminishing cultural power .\nThe coronavirus pandemic is an actual crisis that puts the climate \u201c crisis \u201d into perspective .\nEven if you think we have overreacted , COVID-19 has killed nearly 500,000 people and shattered economies around the globe .\nScientific institutions including WHO and IPCC have undermined their credibility through the repeated politicisation of science .\nTheir future existence and relevance depends on new leadership and serious reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media is allowing for a wider range of new and independent voices to outcompete alarmist environmental journalists at legacy publications .\nNations are reverting openly to self-interest and away from Malthusianism and neoliberalism , which is good for nuclear and bad for renewables .\nThe evidence is overwhelming that our high-energy civilisation is better for people and nature than the low-energy civilisation that climate alarmists would return us to .\nGreenpeace didn \u2019 t save the whales \u2014 switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did .\nThe invitations from IPCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openness to new thinking about climate change and the environment .\nAnother one has been to the response to my book from climate scientists , conservationists and \u00adenvironmental scholars .\n\u201c Apocalypse Never is an extremely \u00adimportant book , \u201d writes Richard Rhodes , the Pulitzer-winning \u00adauthor of The Making of the Atomic Bomb .\n\u201c This may be the most important book on the environment ever written , \u201d says one of the fathers of modern climate science , Tom Wigley .\n\u201c We environmentalists condemn those with antithetical views of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias , \u201d wrote the former head of The Nature Conservancy , Steve McCormick .\n\u201c But too often we are guilty of the same .\nShellenberger offers \u2018 tough love \u2019 : a challenge to entrenched orthodoxies and rigid , self-defeating mindsets .\nApocalypse Never serves up occasionally stinging , but always well-crafted , evidence-based points of view that will help develop the \u2018 mental muscle \u2019 we need to envision and design not only a hopeful , but an attainable , future.\n\u201d That is all I hoped for in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this far , I hope you \u2019 ll agree it \u2019 s perhaps not as strange as it seems that a lifelong environmentalist and progressive felt the need to speak out against the alarmism .\nI further hope that you \u2019 ll accept my apology .\nWatch this brief segment

to cover their faces in public .\nThe move is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties of all Texans .\nAbbott may have based his executive order on inaccurate information about a \u201c rise \u201d in Covid cases due to the Texas State Department of Health Services changing the definition of what constitutes a \u201c Covid case.\n\u201d Thanks goes to Collin County Judge Chris Hill for blowing the whistle on what appears to be a move in mid-May to redefine what was a \u201c Covid \u201d case to open the door to a massive increase \u2013 all to match the mainstream media line that a \u201c second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a Commissioners Court hearing for Collin County on May 18th , it was revealed that while previously the determination of a Covid \u201c case \u201d was a confirmed test result , the definition was suddenly changed to count \u201c probable \u201d cases as \u201c cases.\n\u201d At the same time , the threshold for determining \u201c probable \u201d was lowered to a ridiculous level .\nAs Judge Hill said at that May 18th meeting , \u201c If you have a subjective fever and you have a headache and you live in Collin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a probable COVID patient .\nIt is remarkable how low the standard is now.\n\u201d Even worse , once a \u201c probable \u201d case was determined based on possibly unrelated subjective criteria , up to 15 people in possible contact with that \u201c probable \u201d case were also listed as \u201c probable cases.\n\u201d And \u201c probable cases \u201d were considered cases .\nRepeat that farce across Texas and is it any wonder there was a \u201c spike \u201d in \u201c cases \u201d ?\nAlso , Governor Abbott \u2019 s claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients was refuted by the Houston hospital directors themselves , who said they were nowhere near actual capacity and in fact were about the same level as they were last year .\nThe basis for Abbott \u2019 s unconstitutional \u201c executive order \u201d has been shown to be false .\nWill he admit his mistake ?\nIt is encouraging to see so many local and county officials across Texas announcing they will refuse to enforce Governor Abbott \u2019 s unconstitutional face mask order .\nThankfully the spirit of freedom and love of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c second wave \u201d is driven by propaganda .\nAcross the country , Covid testing increased from about 150,000 to more than 700,000 per day .\nYou can \u2019 t drive through Houston without seeing a flurry of signs advertising \u201c Free Covid test !\nResults in 15 minutes !\n\u201d Last week Reuters reported that tests shipped around the country by the federal government were contaminated .\nDeaths from coronavirus \u2013 even the deaths \u201c with \u201d coronavirus rather than deaths \u201c from \u201d coronavirus \u2013 are down more than 90 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in deaths continues .\nThat means we are closer to the \u201c herd immunity \u201d that will finally kill this virus .\nYet Governor Abbott and others across the country see this as a reason to lock the country back down .", "author": "21wire", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2020/07/08/is-the-texas-covid-second-wave-fake-news/", "published": "Wed, 08 Jul

rails .\nIt started off great , as elites and climatists descended on Davos to press home what looked to be the final mile in ramming through the adoption of some form of global Green New Deal by year \u2019 s end .\nTheir secret weapon , a Swedish teen , was primed , locked and loaded .\nTheir cause was then handed another gift in the Coronavirus lockdowns .\nClimate campaigners were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boasted with claims of lower CO2 levels due the economic shutdown .\nIn just two months , COVID lockdown policies had achieved what climate campaigners had been working for years to realize .\nOr so they thought .\nIt was later revealed that lockdowns had little or no impact on overall CO2 concentration .\nBut since when did a little science get in the way of an apocalyptic juggernaut .\nBut something strange happened on the way to Wuhan .\nOne of the key components of the intergovernmental fear campaign to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nInitially , these were referred to as \u201c The Science \u201d by cock-sure politicians and public health officials .\nThe press quickly fell in line with this groupthink .\nAny dissenters were roundly attacked and deplatformed .\nAs their mission crept on , it became clear that these models were ever only masquerading as \u2018 science \u2019 .\nThe fictional doomsday scenarios being created by technocrats were then snapped up by the mainstream media , and then used them to hound political officials into implementing a one-size-fits-all centralized policy of de-industrialization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s no coincidence that this is exactly what climatists and Green New Deal campaigners have been hoping for .\nPrior to COVID , few dared to publicly challenge the intellectual primacy of computer modelling , especially in the field of climate science .\nSkeptics were simply told , \u201c Shut up !\nThey are experts !\n\u201d Only , it turns out the skeptics were right .\nIt was regarded as infallible , even though just like Neil Ferguson and Imperial College \u2019 s erroneous modelling of pandemics \u2013 these glorified SIM City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fall-out in both the UK and US over these wild computer-generated predictions that were used by governments to adopt lockdown policies has also exposed these crude devices as pseudo-science used to paint an unlikely Armageddon .\nNow , a scorned public is starting to question the assumed authority of computer modelling .\nPeople are beginning to look more cautiously at climate modellers from the IPCC , and serial data masseuses like Michael Mann \u2013 all of whom are being questioned with renewed skepticism .\nNo doubt , this will continue to erode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate dogma which has enjoyed its place on the throne of consensus reality ever since Al Gore released his now discredited documentary film An Inconvenient Truth in 2005 .\nAdding more insult to injury , this year also saw the release of Michael Moore \u2019 s documentary Planet of Humans which completely destroyed the the received green wisdom regarding stalwart solutions for \u2018 green \u2019 energy being touted by environmental activists over the last 30 years .\nFor their blasphemy , both Moore and director Jeff Gibbs were branded heretics by the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank on the green new gospel .\nThis incident was then followed by the release of the new book , Apocalypse Never : Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All , by green policy expert Michael Shellenberg .\nThe book quickly shot up to number # 3 top seller on Amazon and has since drawn fire from activists who claim that like Moore , the author has stabbed the climate movement in the back by revealing some of the trade secrets of green activism .\nBut Shellenberger is merely pointed out the obvious \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth mass extinction , \u201d that climate change is not making natural disasters worse , and that CO2 emissions are actually plateaued in most developed nations .\nFor this , he has been mercilessly attacked by climate clerics .\nAnd that brings us back to Generation X , Y , Z \u2019 s ( and liberal Boomers too ) latter day Joan of Arch , the mercurial Swede , Greta Thunberg .\nBefore coronavirus , her stock was riding high \u2013 halfway into a glorious gap year and transatlantic carbon-neutral sailing excursion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summit in Spain , and then on to the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , where she rubbed elbows with Charles , the Prince of Wales .\nAt Davos , it was clear that Greta \u2019 s physical appearance had changed .\nShe had lost a lot of weight in a very short space of time \u2013 a far cry from her jovial , bouncy self .\nThis was a new mini-adult , a darker and much more cynical Greta .\nClearly , the miles , the media , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd her disdain for the great and the good was manifest .\nWatch : From there , she would have been looking forward to a spring season meant to culminate in a series of youth \u2018 climate actions \u2019 spanning into summer , maybe an appearance at Glasonbury festival next to some super group , and then leading towards COP26 in Glasgow this November .\nThat was the plan .\nBut unfortunately , with the west \u2019 s student body all but grounded at home by a new more impressive Project Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of her legions of angry adolescents .\nNow donning masks and plastic visors , the youth have other more pressing issues to contend with ; omnipresent fears of the plague , school closures , oppressive social distancing regimes , and mass unemployment \u2013 all of which will trump fears that sea levels might rise a few meters in 200 years time .\nEven COP26 might end up being done on Zoom due to COVID concerns .\nGreta \u2019 s gravitas doesn \u2019 t translate as well in desktop avatar form .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcore climatists reading this , we \u2019 re sorry , that \u2019 s just where things are at now .\nBut Greta is very sharp customer , and will eventually cop on to the game .\nShe has already begun hitting out at slovenly world leaders \u2013 who she claims have been using her to \u201c look good.\n\u201d And she \u2019 s not wrong either .\nCertainly , turnabout is fair play , but we should point out that Greta was a minor through her mercurial rise to fame , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor Svante Thunberg and mother and opera singer Malena Ernman \u2013 who have allowed their daughter to be used as a glorified mascot for political parties , multiple globalist organizations , NGOs and corporate media consortiums .\nIn a recent interview on Swedish radio during the COVID crisis , she accused German chancellor , Angela Merkel , of using her for cheap \u201c selfie \u201d at a UN event in New York .\n\u201c Presidents , prime ministers , kings and princesses came and wanted to talk to me , \u201d said Greta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the chance that they could take a photo with me for their Instagram account .\nThen the hashtag # savetheplanet \u2026 They can post it on social media and it makes them look good , it makes them seem like they care.\n\u201d Her handlers should take heed : she \u2019 s getting more savvy .\nFor those who have actually followed her story , you will know that from day one , Greta Thunberg \u2019 s supposed \u2018 grassroots \u2019 rise was a well-financed and carefully choreographed public relations campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , security and a gaggle of support staff .\nAs time progresses , and as holes in the climate narrative begin to expand , it \u2019 s increasingly likely that Greta herself , now 17 years old , will realize the extent of the financialized operation in which she been used like a tool to wind-up and set in motion .\nAt that point , she will be a full-fledged adult , and thus harder to manage by her handlers working to ferry around selling the New Green Economy .\nSooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , and then forge her own path as a free-thinking adult .\nBy that time , the wheels may have already fallen off the climate change bandwagon .\nThe information berm has now burst .\nWith each passing month , you will see more green realists going off script .\nMore Moore \u2019 s , and more Shellenberger \u2019 s .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean it will stop .\nIf COVID showed us anything , it \u2019 s globalists organizations and their cadres in government are determined to advance their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth Industrial Revolution and UBI utopia .\nShades of Huxley \u2019 s Brave New World .\nThat \u2019 s no exaggeration .\nUS Presidential Election beckons , and there \u2019 s more at stake than ever .\nMany believe a Trump victory could set the climate change agenda back a further ten years .\nSo in terms of expediting this agenda , 2020 is really a do or die year .\n*** This OpEd article was submitted by the editorial team at 21WIRE .", "author": "21wire", "url":

adoption is also stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been aroused in Oakland , California , Seattle , and Chicago , and the applications of laws protecting citizen privacy are murky .\nFor instance : data that \u2019 s stored on a server indefinitely could potentially infringe on the \u201c right to be forgotten \u201d that \u2019 s protected in some European countries .\nBut accountability and recourse can be slippery , because civilians can \u2019 t necessarily sue cities for violating privacy torts , explains Gidari .\nWhat would it look like to leapfrog that murkiness by opting out entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance ?\nI asked Gidari and Lee Tien , a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , to teach me how to disappear .\nDuring the course of our conversations , Tien and Gidari each remind me , again and again , that this was a fool \u2019 s errand : You can \u2019 t truly hide from urban surveillance .\nIn an email before our phone call , Tien points out that we \u2019 re not even aware of all the traces of ourselves that are out in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters , streetlight cameras , automatic license plate readers , and more\u2014to a kind of binary DNA that we \u2019 re constantly sloughing .\nTrying to scrub these streams of data would be impossible .\nMoreover , as the tools of surveillance have become more sophisticated , detecting them has become a harder task .\n\u201c There was a time when you could spot cameras , \u201d Tien says .\nMaybe a bodega would hang up a metal sign warning passersby that they were being recorded by a clunky , conspicuous device .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , recessed , and don \u2019 t look like what you expect them to look like.\n\u201d Other cameras are in the sky .\nAs Buzzfeed has reported , some federal surveillance technologies are mounted in sound-dampened planes and helicopters that cruise over cities , using augmented reality to overlay a grid that identifies targets at a granular level .\n\u201c There are sensors everywhere , \u201d Gidari says .\n\u201c The public has no ability to even see where they are.\n\u201d The surest way to dodge surveillance is to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not a simple ask .\nWhile various groups have tried to plot out routes that allow pedestrians to literally sidestep nodes of surveillance , they haven \u2019 t been especially successful .\nIn 2013 , two software developers released a beta version of an app called Surv , which aspired to be a crowdsourced guide to cameras mounted in cities around the world .\nThe app would detect cameras within a 100-meter radius of the user \u2019 s phone , but it failed to meet its crowdfunding threshold on Kickstarter .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ least practical ones .\nTo defeat facial recognition software , \u201c you would have to wear a mask or disguises , \u201d Tien says .\n\u201c That doesn \u2019 t really scale up for people.\n\u201d Other strategies include makeup that screws with a camera \u2019 s ability to recognize the contours of a human face , or thwarting cameras by blinding them with infrared LED lights fastened to a hat or glasses , as researchers at Japan \u2019 s National Institute of Informatics attempted in 2012 .\nThose techniques are hardly subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would stick out to the naked eye .\nAnd as biometrics continue to advance , cameras will likely be less dupable , too .\nThere are also legal hiccups to consider : Drivers who don \u2019 t want city officials to know where they parked or when , Gidari says , would have to outwit license plate recognition tools by obscuring their license plate , such as with the noPhoto camera jammer , a new $ 399 device that fires a flash at red light cameras in an attempt to scramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already illegal in many cities and states , and others are chewing on new procedures .\nIn their book Obfuscation : A User \u2019 s Guide for Privacy and Protest , Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum , both professors at New York University , champion a strategy of \u201c throwing some sand in the gears , kicking up dust and making some noise , \u201d essentially relying on the melee of data jamming to \u201c hide in a cloud of signals.\n\u201d A number of apps , websites , and browser extensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misdirection\u2014say , for instance , by running in the background of your regular web activities , trying to cover your digital tracks by throwing surveillance off your scent .\nFor example : A site called Internet Noise searches for randomized phrases and opens five fresh tabs every ten seconds .\n( I left it running as I wrote this , and now my browser history includes pictures of badgers , an online mattress store , an NPR article about the Supreme Court , and a research paper about gene mutation in hamsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s not a perfect veil , writes Emily Dreyfess in Wired : \u201c It \u2019 s actually too random .\nIt doesn \u2019 t linger on sites very long , nor does it revisit them .\nIn other words , it doesn \u2019 t really look human , and smart-enough tracking algorithms likely know that.\n\u201d The site is more of a protest over Congress rolling back a not-yet-implemented FCC regulation that would have stymied ISPs from selling users \u2019 browsing history .\nStill , Tien advocates a certain degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of digital hygiene\u2014the \u201c equivalent of washing your hands when you go to the bathroom , \u201d or getting a flu shot .\nBut he stresses that they \u2019 re only a partial prophylactic : \u201c Nothing that will make you immune from the problem.\n\u201d Other techniques include employing Tor\u2014a network that tries to anonymize the source and destination of your web searches by routing traffic along a convoluted path\u2014and Signal , which offers encrypted messaging and phone calls .\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2019 s Surveillance Self-Defense toolkit also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios .\nPeople participating in protests , the guide suggests , might consider stripping meta-data from photos , to make it harder to match them with identities and locations .\nBut this isn \u2019 t a perfect solution , either , Tien says , because you can only control what you post .\n\u201c If I take a picture and scrub the metadata , that \u2019 s one thing , \u201d Tien says .\n\u201c If my friend takes a picture of me , I can \u2019 t do anything about that.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions for phone security at a protest , from adding an access passcode to turning on encryption settings .\nOn a daily basis , Tien tells me , \u201c I don \u2019 t think you or I can exercise much meaningful self-help against the kind of tracking we \u2019 ll be seeing in real-world physical space.\n\u201d That \u2019 s fodder for a point he makes about a fundamental asymmetry in the information that \u2019 s available to the bodies that install the cameras and those who are surveilled by them .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation of privacy in a public space .\nThe officials and organizations that install sensors , cameras , and ever-more-sensitive devices , he says , \u201c have much more money than you do , much more technology than you do , and they don \u2019 t have to tell you what they \u2019 re doing.\n\u201d Ultimately , Tien and Gidari both take a long view , arguing that the most payoff will come from pushing for more transparency about just what this technology is up to .\nPart and parcel of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that data is inherently neutral .\nThe whole messy , jumbled mass of it contains information that could have tangible consequences on people \u2019 s lives .\nTien says citizens need to remind their elected officials what \u2019 s at stake with data\u2014and in the process , maybe \u201c dampen their enthusiasm \u201d for the collection of it .\nHe points out that sanctuary cities could be a prime example .\nThere , he says , some advocates of immigrant rights are realizing that data collected via municipal surveillance \u201c might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re interested in protecting immigrants and the federal government is interested in deporting them.\n\u201d The practical strategies for opting out\u2014of becoming invisible to some of these modes of surveillance\u2014are imperfect , to say the least .\nThat \u2019 s not to say that data collection is inherently nefarious , Gidari says\u2014as he wrote in a blog post for the CIS , \u201c no one wants to live in a \u2018 dumb \u2019 city.\n\u201d But he says that opting out shouldn \u2019 t need to be the default : \u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been opted in in the first place.\n\u201d Jessica Leigh Hester is a former senior associate editor at CityLab , covering

unseasonable mortality anywhere until Lockdown regimes were imposed between late February and late March 2020 .\nLet me repeat that : everywhere , the overall or \u201c all cause \u201d mortality data consistently tells the same story : there was no notable deviation from the statistical norm in any country until lockdown regimes were imposed .\nAccording to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , at the time of writing , with 11,841,326 supposedly confirmed cases and 544,739 alleged deaths , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 0.15 % of the global population and has allegedly led to the deaths of 0.007 % .\nThis makes it slightly less deadly than a bad seasonal influenza which can kill 0.0085 % of the world \u2019 s populace in a single year .\nYet governments around the world decided that the only way to respond to this particular respiratory infection was to roll out the most oppressive form of governance ever seen in the west , outside of a time of war .\nThe measures taken by our \u201c elected representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will prematurely end the lives of many more in the weeks and months ahead .\nI began this article with the claim that SARS-CoV-2 \u201c has been circulating for at least a year \u201d .\nThe evidence for this statement has come from tests of sewage in multiple countries .\nThe Italian National Institute of Health ( ISS ) found SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples collected on December 18th 2019 from Milan and Turin .\nTwo separate samples , gathered independently , from Brazilian wastewater showed the that the virus had been present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Barcelona found a number of samples indicating the presence of the virus in mid January 2020 , 6 weeks before the Spanish Lockdown , with one sample dating as far back as March 2019 , a year before any lockdown regimes were rolled out .\nThe science behind wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is well established and , in April 2020 , Australian researchers confirmed detection in wastewater as proof of concept for wastewater based epidemiology ( WBE ) for SARS-CoV-2 .\nFurther studies support its efficacy .\nPrior to the release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the available science on the possible faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA found consistent evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal matter .\nLooking at 26 relevant studies , researchers noted that nearly 54 % of stool samples taken from confirmed COVID-19 patients contained SARS-CoV-2 .\nThey concluded : While knowledge gaps remain , the debate about WBE for SARS-CoV-2 is about how best to use it , potentially as a predictive tool for future outbreaks .\nThere is little doubt that RNA from SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in sewage .\nConsequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples which raises significant questions , not the scientific credibility of the sampling process .\nThe claims of so called fact checkers that no inference can be drawn from these sample dates , due to the likelihood of false positives , are specious .\nOnce found , the samples were tested with RT-PCR , the common test for SARS-CoV-2 .\nFact checker attempts to downplay the significance of these results , by citing possible false positives , also provides reason to question every other diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR \u2014 the predominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based .\nThere has been some resistance to accepting the growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 had already spread across continents long before the WHO declared a global pandemic .\nClaire Crossan , research fellow in virology at Glasgow Caledonian University , explained : This evidence runs contrary to all that we have we have been told about COVID-19 .\nCrossan was right to observe that Spanish , Brazilian and Italian results did not correspond to any known outbreak of the associated COVID-19 syndrome .\nThis is no reason to discard this evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevailing COVID-19 narrative .\nDue to the quite remarkable debasement of normal death registration procedures in England and Wales , under the 2020 Coronavirus Act , it has become virtually impossible to identify cause of death within the resulting statistics .\nIt is , however , much harder to politicise total numbers of deaths .\nBy looking at all cause mortality , despite all the COVID-19 fear porn pumped out by the MSM , it is possible to reach a relatively accurate analysis .\nIn his recent technical report Denis Rancourt Ph.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ottawa , highlighted this problem : When weekly deaths for England and Wales , covering the last decade , are plotted we can see that all cause mortality has been broadly consistent .\nEvery winter sees an increase , as mortality rises sharply during the colder and less humid winter months .\nRespiratory like illness , such as flu , pneumonia and SARS , are diminished by increased summertime humidity .\nConsequently the mortality risk , especially for those with severe comorbidity , such as cardiovascular disease and cancer , increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths on a weekly bases the incline of the peak shows the death rate .\nThat is , the more people who die per week , the higher and sharper the spike appears .\nThe total number of deaths are represented by the area beneath the peaks .\nSo a very high but narrow spike in mortality does not necessarily mean that an unusually large number of people have died .\nIt suggests something caused people to die in a distinct cluster .\nIf we look at the last 10 years of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two facts are evident : \u2022 people have died at a significantly increased rate over a very short timescale in 2020 \u2022 a mortality spike occurred much later in the year than has been observed in previous years These marked statistical features are nearly identical for all lockdown countries .\nThe first cluster of COVID-19 cases supposedly emerged in China in December 2019 , though it had already made its way to Italy , Spain and Brazil by then .\nInitial cases in the U.S. were seen in late January with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first outbreak reported cluster occurred in Italy in early February and community infection in Spain was underway by mid February .\nThe UK saw its \u2019 first confirmed case in January and person to person transmission had also emerged by early February .\nNew Zealand and Australia reported cases in late February , as did Brazil .\nFrom the official Wuhan outbreak it supposedly took just 9 weeks for SARS-CoV-2 to spread around the world .\nWith the symptoms typically emerging between 5-6 days post infection , COVID-19 , and associated mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus .\nThe WHO declared a global pandemic on the 11th of March .\nIf the hope was to stop SARS-CoV-2 \u2019 s global contagion , we now know this was a rather belated effort .\nIf the speed of transmission is as we are told , then it had already spread around the world by December 2019 , at the latest .\nA pandemic shouldn \u2019 t be a political decision , it should be an evident reality .\nAs I have shown above , the increasing body of evidence demonstrating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the normal flu season , raises the question of why it took months for anyone notice COVID-19 in Italy , Spain , Brazil or the UK ?\nIf COVID-19 is responsible for the spikes in mortality which have been seen from March until June , why did SARS-CoV-2 wait until lockdowns were implemented to begin killing people ?\nViruses don \u2019 t pander to the whims of policy think tanks and no one , anywhere , had implemented any stringent measures , either to control the spread or mitigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stamped into existence .\nThe virus was free to do its thing for months and yet it apparently did nothing .\nWhile no policy maker had any idea that the virus had been in circulation for months , their attempts to \u201c flatten the curve \u201d accurately predicted the onset of rapidly increasing mortality with uniform precision in every country .\nHow could they have known that their lockdown regimes would be so perfectly timed to \u201c flatten any curve ?\n\u201d For this article , I will primarily discuss the Lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same issues I will raise here can be found wherever the lockdown hammer fell .\nIt is generally recognised that the vast majority of those who have died with COVID-19 had at least one serious comorbidity and were over 65 years old with more than 83 % over 70 .\nThe deaths have occurred almost exclusively among those who were approaching , or already receiving , end of life care .\nTheir deaths were precipitated either by a latent virus which only became active once the political class were ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the political response to the WHO \u2019 s declared \u201c global pandemic.\n\u201d If the intention was to protect the most vulnerable , then many Lockdown regime policies and decisions were , at best , criminally negligent .\nIn combination , they appear to be suspiciously close to a deliberate program of euthanasia .\nThe mortality spike in England and Wales peaked between 9 \u2013 12 April .\nIt was at this time that NHS England withdrew their \u201c do not convey to hospital \u201d guidance .\nPrior to this withdrawal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in place in order to \u201c protect the NHS , \u201d NHS England decided not to allow specified groups of vulnerable patients to be admitted to hospital .\nThis meant not treating those over the age of 70 , who displayed normal vital signs , and any who had supposedly elected not to be resuscitated , regardless of their health condition .\nAt the same time the government and the NHS were pressurising vulnerable older people to sign \u201c do not attempt resuscitation \u201d ( DNAR ) notices .\nAmid all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the NHS , vulnerable people were sent DNAR notice agreement forms through the post ( my elderly father received one ) and there were numerous reports of these being completed en masse without the older persons consent in care settings , automatically excluding vulnerable people from hospital treatment .\nFurther , the guidance advised that vulnerable people should not be taken to Accident and Emergency departments unless approved by a clinical adviser , thereby increasing the delay in treatment during the vital golden hour .\nThis caused considerable concern amongst health professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential dissent , it has become increasingly apparent that UK NHS staff are subject to strict gagging orders .\nThose who have spoken out are either retired or have done so anonymously .\nFor example , speaking about the introduction of an additional \u201c clinical adviser \u201d into the golden hour window , an anonymous senior NHS leader spoke to the Health Service Journal : Correlation doesn \u2019 t equal causation but , nonetheless , this specific guidance was withdrawn at the same time that mortality peaked and the death rate began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply discard this correlation .\nIt is one among many .\nThe demands of the lockdown regime also saw ambulance response times increase significantly .\nMost notably in London , where they more than trebled for the most seriously ill \u201c category 2 patients , \u201d including heart attack and stroke victims .\nDuring the peak of the outbreak 9 out of 10 of the local authorities with the highest mortality rates were London boroughs .\nPresentations to Accident and Emergency departments ( ED \u2019 s ) were down by 50 % in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & E attendance was down by 53 % nationally during the lockdown .\nCancer screening and treatment was put on hold .\nCancer Research UK estimated that 290,000 people missed cancer follow ups , indicating that around 20,000 current cancer sufferers , who could otherwise have accessed treatment , remain untreated or possibly unaware of their cancer .\nAt least 2.4 million people missed cancer screening appointment during the lockdown .\nAs the the NHS Confederation warns that the backlog of planned treatments , including for life threatening and life limiting conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lockdown regime has also seen cancer referrals drop by 45 % .\nSome scientists have estimated this could mean an additional 35,000 excess cancer deaths in the UK .\nThere were no fewer people contracting cancer , but the real world impact of the Lockdown regime is that fewer lives will now be saved while many have undoubtedly already been lost .\nWe are currently inundated with warnings of future lockdowns and local UK lockdowns have already begun in Leicester .\nMany people are already living in fear of the alleged threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are willing to comply with any diktat from the government , regardless of scientific justification or lack of it .\nIt is extremely difficult to envisage how health services will manage the enormous treatment backlog and many health professionals are warning of the likelihood that they won \u2019 t .\nAs winter approaches and natural mortality increases , the pressure on services will be immense .\nAnother large spike in mortality in the Autumn is a terrible but seemingly unavoidable prospect .\nGiven what we already know about the appalling manipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only guess how many of these deaths will ultimately be attributed to the second wave of COVID-19 .\nThe Lockdown regime \u2019 s impact upon those with cardiovascular disease and heart conditions has been equally deleterious .\nPatients report difficulty accessing treatment or even obtaining the vital medication they need .\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan , Associate Medical Director of the British Heart Foundations , said : The pervasive nature of our collective delusion is notable .\nEven renowned heart specialists seem incapable of acknowledging the truth .\nHeart disease is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 .\nDuring the lockdown , A & E presentations for heart attacks and strokes dropped by more than half .\nThis resulted in a huge increase of deaths in the home .\nIt wasn \u2019 t COVID-19 that killed the majority of these people .\nThey lost their lives because they either couldn \u2019 t or wouldn \u2019 t access hospital treatment .\nThe most vulnerable were sent letters telling them to stay at home to \u201c protect the NHS ; \u201d ambulance response times increased ; access to hospital treatment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis was not \u201c because of coronavirus \u201d or even \u201c due to the response.\n\u201d It is the result of a vicious Lockdown regime .\nIt is ludicrous to imagine that the cumulative effect of these lockdown policies didn \u2019 t lead to early mortality among the most vulnerable .\nThe lockdown regime was detrimental to the health of the very demographic it was supposedly designed to \u201c keep safe.\n\u201d While there is no evidence that COVID-19 presents any risk to children , there is evidence that the Lockdown regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also down for children , raising concerns they they have not been receiving the health care they need .\nRegardless of the MSM \u2019 s unrelenting assertion that these problems are caused by coronavirus , it has been the Lockdown regime \u2019 s policies , coupled with the MSM \u2019 s omnipresent fear porn , that has deterred frightened parents and increased the health risks for children .\nThe level of MSM disinformation during the lockdown has been staggering .\nFor example , without questioning or verifying anything , they carelessly reported claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care settings .\nCloser analysis of those figures revealed these assessments were based upon little more than assumptions .\nIn reality , the vast majority of those claimed coronavirus deaths were not related to COVID-19 .\nWe should remember this as we consider the huge impact of lockdown regime policies on the most vulnerable people in society : those in care and nursing homes , and those who require home care .\nOnce again , another notable correlation is evident .\nWith its ever changing , bewildering policy guidance , it was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the UK government changed its recommendation to the NHS and stated that all patients must be tested for SARS-CoV-2 prior to discharge from hospital .\nHowever , while every relatively healthy person , for whom COVID-19 presents virtually no threat , will be forced into quarantine for 14 days if they are even suspected of being in contact with someone who may have SARS-CoV-2 , that same degree of caution does not apply the the most vulnerable .\nThe current guidance states : Having sent an unknown number of infectious people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government issued lockdown regime guidance to care staff recommending that they should not provide any care without the necessary personal protective equipment ( PPE ) .\nThe same policy makers then neglected to provide access to that PPE .\nAs a result , the mounting stress and anxiety of care staff exacerbated the furlough staffing crisis .\nMany staff members in nursing homes are medically qualified , this is not the case in the majority of care homes or among those providing community care .\nThey are reliant upon primary care advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown regime virtually removed GP support from care settings and the community .\nPeople have had to get used to telephone consultations instead of examinations and home visits .\nThereby , hugely increasing the risk to the most vulnerable in the middle of an alleged global pandemic .\nGuidance to GP \u2019 s from NHS England stated that possible COVID-19 patients should be identified primarily by weekly check-ins online .\nThis was in keeping with the NHS Key Principles of General Practice , in relation to COVID-19 , which stated : Care home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , as they struggled to cope with the condition created by the Lockdown regime .\nDespite representatives from the medical profession claiming that not providing medical interventions during a pandemic was \u201c sufficient , \u201d Vic Rayner , executive director of the National Care Forum , observed : The UK government \u2019 s , or any government \u2019 s , claim that their ongoing Lockdown regime is intended to \u201c protect the most vulnerable \u201d is not credible .\nThe consistency with which lockdown policies have increased , rather than reduced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a common feature of every lockdown .\nSimultaneously , every Lockdown regime has placed those not at risk under ever more authoritarian rule .\nQuarantining the healthy is yet another Lockdown regime policy which escalates the risk for vulnerable people .\nWhile the vulnerable were being sent back into high risk , poorly protected and understaffed care homes , hospital bed occupancy , across the country , was at a record low .\nWhether by design or criminal neglect , lockdown policy has actively targeted the most vulnerable , singling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premature mortality is the inevitable and obvious result .\nWe have clear evidence that the Lockdown regime has caused , and will continue to cause , ill health and death .\nWe also know that it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 had already spread around the world before any lockdowns were initiated .\nWe also know that the virus lay virtually dormant and only decided to cause statistically significant mortality after the lockdowns began .\nWe can now add the observations that the harshest elements of the lockdown , namely the refusal to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people back into high risk communities , only relented as peak mortality began to wane .\nWe can also see , as lockdown restrictions eased , so did the mortality rate .\nNothing discussed here suggests that there is no virus or that COVID-19 doesn \u2019 t present a threat to health .\nIt suggests that if your response to a public health crisis is to withdraw healthcare from those who need it the most , a spike in mortality is the only possible outcome .\nNot only are those affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but increased mortality from every other comorbidity is hard wired into that lockdown policy .\nThis would seem to account for the strong correlation between the imposition of healthcare limiting lockdowns and sharp increases in mortality .\nWe can postulate that , prior to this , the virus was causing some mortality within the normal range and distribution of seasonable respiratory illness .\nOnce the WHO identified the \u201c novel \u201d virus and declared a global pandemic , it was the ensuing Lockdown regimes which prompted unseasonable spikes in mortality .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease that had long been present .\nItaly \u2019 s National Institute of Health ( ISS ) found that only 12 % of reported COVID-19 deaths were actually attributable to the COVID-19 syndrome .\nPerhaps this explains why another aspect of many Lockdown regimes has been the creation of indecipherable mortality recording systems .\nThe immediate response will be that this is a circular argument .\nThe Lockdown Regime responded to the conditions on the ground .\nPolicies adapted to circumstances at the time .\nAs mortality reduced some restrictions could be lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a similar pattern found in a non lockdown country like Sweden ?\nWhile Sweden didn \u2019 t adopt the economic shutdown favoured by other European states , it did operate a policy of socially isolating the most vulnerable in poorly staffed , overcrowded care homes .\nSwedish care homes have been in a staffing crisis for many years , and this problem was compounded by the Swedish decision to tell all staff , who had any symptom ranging from a headache to a stiff knee , to stay at home .\nHigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an established problem and seasonal flu mortality in Swedish care homes is appallingly high .\nThe MSM , desperate to justify their own national lockdown regimes on behalf of their partners and leading advertisers , the government , have used Sweden \u2019 s high mortality in care homes as a stick to beat them with .\nIn reality , instead of MSM propaganda land , around 50 % of all recorded COVID-19 deaths across Europe , including in the UK , have been in care settings .\nSweden has openly admitted its error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Affairs Minister , stated in a national television interview : It remains to be seen if Sweden will address the systemic failings within it \u2019 s care sector .\nMeanwhile Lockdown Regimes around the world persist with the lie that abandoning those most in need will \u201c save lives.\n\u201d In light of all the other factors we have discussed , it is reasonable to conclude that the majority of deaths reported as COVID-19 mortality , by the world \u2019 s mainstream media ( MSM ) , were not attributable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various national and statewide lockdown policies .\nThese were Lockdown regime deaths not COVID-19 deaths .\nBy restricting access to health care for the most vulnerable , any claim that Lockdown Regimes save lives is patently absurd .\nThis story was originally published at UK Column.org .", "author":

prevailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks with Prof Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine .\nWatch : 2:55 \u2013 Masks \u2022 Tom Jefferson : \u201c Aside from people who are exposed on the frontlines , there is no evidence that masks make any difference , but what \u2019 s even more extraordinary is the uncertainty : we don \u2019 t know if these things make any difference\u2026 .\nWe should have done randomised control trials in February , March and April but not anymore because viral circulation is low and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there was any difference \u201d .\n\u2022 Carl Heneghan : \u201c By all means people can wear masks but they can \u2019 t say it \u2019 s an evidence-based decision\u2026 there is a real separation between an evidence-based decision and the opaque term that \u2018 we are being led by the science \u2019 , which isn \u2019 t the evidence \u201d .\n9:26 \u2013 Pandemic life cycle \u2022 CH : \u201c One of the keys of the infection is to look at who \u2019 s been infected , which shows a crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal theory .\nIn a pandemic you \u2019 d expect to see young people disproportionately affected , but in the UK we \u2019 ve only had six child deaths , which is far less than we \u2019 d normally see in a pandemic .\nThe high number of deaths with over-75s fits with the seasonal theory \u201d .\n14:00 \u2013 Covid seasonality \u2022 CH : \u201c The stability of the virus is far less when the temperature goes up but humidity seems to be particularly important .\nThe lower the humidity , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere and on surfaces\u2026 It \u2019 s now winter in the southern hemisphere , which is why places like Australia are suddenly having outbreaks.\n\u201d 20:37 \u2013 Lockdown \u2022 CH : \u201c Many people said that we should have locked down earlier , but 50 % of care homes developed outbreaks during the lockdown period so there are issues within the transmission of this virus that are not clear\u2026 Lockdown is a blunt tool and there needs to be intelligent conversations about what mitigation strategies can keep society functioning while we keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightingale hospitals \u2022 CH : \u201c They are the wrong structure .\nWhat you need is fever hospitals which were here until around the 1980s or 90s .\nThey were on single floors and had isolation within isolation .\nTheere were no lift shafts and staff were trained , which meant that everyone was protected from each other\u2026 It looks like at leats 20 % of people got the infection while they were in hospital \u201d 27:30 \u2013 Suppression strategy \u2022 CH : \u201c The benefits of the current strategy are outweighed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the virus will have a determination in that .\nIf you follow the New Zealand policy of suppressing it to zero and locking down the country forever , then you \u2019 re going to have a problem\u2026 This virus is so out there now , I can not see a strategy that makes suppression the viable option .\nThe strategy right now should be how we learn to live with this virus \u201d 32:45 \u2013 Response to the virus \u2022 TJ : \u201c I am a survivor of four pandemics and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t even realise they were going on .\nPeople died but nothing changed and none of the fabric of society was eroded like this response\u2026 Do I see steps being taken at a European level about learning from our mistakes and changing policies ?\nThe answer is no\u2026 39:30 \u2013 Politics of the virus \u2022 CH : \u201c We as individuals are part of the problem because sensationalism drives people to click and read the information .\nSo it \u2019 s a big circle because we \u2019 ve created the problem \u2014 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , we will go and have a look .\nIf you want a solution , you \u2019 ve got to get people to stop clicking on this sensationalist stuff \u201d .\n43:30 \u2013 Infection Fatality Rate \u2022 CH : \u201c We will be down about where we were with the swine flu : around 0.1-0.3 % which is much lower than what we think because at the moment we are seeing the case fatality \u201d .\n\u2022 TJ : \u201c If you look at the whole narrative , it was distorted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenza which was just one or two agents and nothing else existed .\nWe \u2019 re no different now \u201d .", "author": "21wire", "url":

indicates that some parts of the UK may have already reached what is known as \u2018 herd immunity \u2019 from COVID , revealing \u201c innate resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.\n\u201d Surprisingly , instead of celebrating these findings , politicians and mainstream media are actively ignoring them , and instead are claiming the threat of COVID is on the rise , and demanding the public accept mandatory masks , vaccines and rolling lockdowns .\nFrom the onset of this \u2018 crisis , \u2019 the UK government has been pushing ever-increasing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of a threat which is still vague and largely undetermined .\nOne expert leading the Oxford team is epidemiologist Professor Sunetra Gupta , who argues that the cost of lockdown may be too high for the most disadvantaged , and for society as whole .\nGupta also challenges the parameters of debate the entire debate we are witnessing .\nThe following interview was conducted by The Reaction , with Maggie Pagano , Alastair Benn and Mutaz Ahmed interviewing Professor Sunetra Gupta from Oxford University : Alastair : In the debate over T-cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common-sense view is that exposure to things that are similar does give you some protection , and it seems to be borne out in recent studies .\nProf Gupta : Yes , exactly .\nThe principle of protection from exposure to related viruses , and indeed any kind of pathogen , is one that we \u2019 ve known for a very long time .\nThe very first vaccine we had , which is smallpox , was based on the idea that cowpox protects against smallpox .\nThis idea was already there well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virus \u2013 and indeed in advance of germ theory having been properly established .\nSo we knew about this cross protection even before we knew that diseases were caused by germs .\nIt \u2019 s a very old idea .\nIn my own studies , beginning with malaria and then later thinking about flu , the role of cross-immunity in protecting against disease seemed to be something that very much needed to be factored into our thinking .\nMost of the people who die from malaria are children , and they die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no immunity at that stage .\nThat was one of the first things that struck me when I was working on malaria .\nAnd then later when I was working on flu , it seemed to me a very good way of explaining why the 1918 flu had killed so many people , but why that didn \u2019 t seem to be repeating itself , was that it was likely that people hadn \u2019 t been exposed to flu .\nMany people would have not had the flu at all .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naive immunity in people under the age of thirty who were very badly affected when the pandemic came through .\nHaving those ideas in mind , when the Covid-19 virus started to spread , I was pretty certain it wouldn \u2019 t have a huge , devastating impact in terms of mortality , because we had all these other coronaviruses circulating .\nWhat I didn \u2019 t anticipate was that some of our responses to previous exposure to seasonal coronaviruses might actually protect us from infection .\nIt \u2019 s one thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the new studies are showing is that people are actually fighting off infection .\nSo at an even more basic level , the pre-existing antibodies or T-cell responses against coronaviruses seem to protect against infection , not just the outcome of infection .\nMutaz : When the serological studies were conducted a couple of months ago , antibody rates were very low in the UK .\nIs that because people weren \u2019 t vulnerable to infection , or because once they were infected they had some level of innate immunity ?\nPG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seropositivity rates in many parts of the world are much lower than we \u2019 d expect them to be if we assume that the epidemic has passed through and that people are resistant .\nIf you take a very simple scenario where everyone is susceptible , you \u2019 d expect 60-70 % of them to have some marker of exposure .\nAnd that is not what \u2019 s been observed .\nI mean , there are areas where it is very high .\nThere \u2019 s a paper published recently of a seroprevalence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aires , which reports a 50 % seroprevalence .\nAnd there have been studies from Lodi , Italy , where it is I think 60 % .\nSo there are studies on the high side , but I think one can \u2019 t really trust studies on either side completely .\nOne has to take all these measures with a certain degree of caution .\nWhat we have here are a range of measures .\nIn cities , it \u2019 s typically much higher than in rural areas or areas that are non-urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s been done in reporting the seroprevalence , which is not correct , is that they \u2019 ve been homogenised .\nWhen people say only 5-6 % of the UK population has been exposed , that \u2019 s not correct .\nI think very few people would agree that exposure rates in London are less than 20 % .\nThe picture that we \u2019 re getting is heterogeneous .\nBut even in hotspots , apart from a few reports , they \u2019 re still quite low .\nSo why is that ?\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of infection , so it was halted at a stage when , say , 20 % of people were immune and the rest of the people were still susceptible to infection .\nWell , under those circumstances , the easing of lockdown should result in fairly rapid growth of cases .\nAnd that \u2019 s not something we \u2019 re seeing .\nSo we \u2019 ve got those two bits of information .\nThe third bit , the missing piece of the puzzle , is this idea that some people are fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have really good defences .\nThat could just be part of our innate immunological makeup .\nIt \u2019 s also becoming clear that some of the people that have beaten it off have had responses to other coronaviruses which could have played a role .\nThe other bit of the puzzle is that some people do get infected and they make antibody responses , but those responses die very quickly .\nSo if you \u2019 re trying to measure exposure , you won \u2019 t get the full picture .\nSome of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We \u2019 ve got four pieces of the puzzle , then .\nIf we put them all together , which is what the paper that we published on Friday does , it gives you a theoretical framework that you can use to look at how these bits connect up together .\nYou can see two things .\nYou can see why the seroprevalence level might be low , and you can also infer that the level of herd immunity needed to stop the thing from exploding again is actually much lower than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite incautiously might suggest .\nAlastair : In a sense , there \u2019 s a control group , Sweden , which is a heterogeneous population with a couple of decent sized cities and a lot of towns , and it \u2019 s precisely as you illustrate .\nSomething happens to the epidemic and it dwindles .\nPG : The fifth piece of this jigsaw could be that there is some seasonality .\nI suspect that in the winter it will probably come back , but hopefully only to the regions where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the seroprevalence levels are genuinely extremely low .\nWe can be cautiously hopeful that in areas where the seroprevalence levels have achieved a certain value that \u2019 s compatible with there being a proportion who are resistant , that it might not come back with such vehemence .\nMutaz : Your paper said that in this framework , if you combine all factors , the exposure requirement could be as low as 25 % for a certain area to reach the herd immunity threshold .\nPG : So , there \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point at which enough people are immune to a pathogen that the rate of growth will start to decline .\nBut there will still be more cases .\nTypically in an epidemic , we overshoot that threshold .\nSo if you see an area that has a seroprevalence with 60 % , that doesn \u2019 t mean that herd immunity can \u2019 t be much lower than that .\nWhat that threshold does define for us is how many people in the community you need to be immune for that thing not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s interesting that you mentioned folklore .\nIn the West we have this idea that we want to eliminate disease \u2013 that there \u2019 s a heroic figure who intervenes and then resets the social order .\nIn some parts of Asia there is a very different approach , it \u2019 s more about accommodating yourself to the natural world , and cultivating a more holistic view of how you live with disaster .\nThings like lockdown have their own folklore .\nPG : Yes , that seems to be much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s semi-religious , actually .\nAs you say , I \u2019 m astonished at two things .\nOne is the bellicose language used with respect to the virus , which does point to this desire to annihilate , which seems to me strange .\nMaybe it has something to do with coming from an eastern tradition , but I \u2019 d like to think it \u2019 s strange because we live with infectious diseases .\nWe do accommodate infectious diseases into our social contract , really .\nWe know that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other interesting issue that I \u2019 ve suddenly realised with this particular threat , is that people are treating it like an external disaster , like a hurricane or a tsunami , as if you can batten down the hatches and it will be gone eventually .\nThat is simply not correct .\nThe epidemic is an ecological relationship that we have to manage between ourselves and the virus .\nBut instead , people are looking at it as a completely external thing .\nWhat \u2019 s disappointed me about the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been approached along a single axis , which , if you like , is a scientific one .\nEven within that context , you could argue that it \u2019 s too one-dimensional , so we \u2019 re not thinking about what \u2019 s happening with other infectious diseases or how many people are going to die of cancer .\nThat \u2019 s the axis of disease , but then there \u2019 s the socioeconomic axis , which has been ignored .\nBut there \u2019 s a third , aesthetic access , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives .\nWe are closing ourselves off not just to the disease , but to other aspects of being human .\nAlastair : We talk about international travel as a disease vector , and talk about how we \u2019 ll never get back to that normal .\nIt \u2019 s the sledgehammer idea that you can eliminate it by stopping mixing .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of false trade-off .\nPG : I think the trade-off is very extreme .\nObviously the most extreme manifestation of that trade-off is the 23 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty line as a result of this sledgehammer approach .\nThe costs to the arts is I think also incredibly profound \u2013 the theatres and all other forms of performing art .\nBut also the inherent art of living , which I think is being compromised .\nActs of kindness are being eschewed .\nSomeone was telling me yesterday that their mother said to them \u201c please don \u2019 t come home , you \u2019 re going to kill us \u201d .\nMaggie : The lockdown has been so successful that people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politicians , and others such as yourself , can do to help us return to normal ?\nPG : What politicians can do is maybe alter their language to reflect that we do live with risk , we have to make quite difficult decisions about trade-offs that exist between ways of life , between livelihoods , and sacrifices that have to be made at a societal level .\nThey would do well to urge people to think at a communitarian level .\nI think the lockdown is really individualistic in its general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the community , such as individual risk , and individual blame .\nNow I see young people being terrified , even though they realise the risk to themselves is low , that they might infect a friend who will then give it to their grandparents .\nThis chain of guilt is somehow located to the individual rather than being distributed and shared .\nWe have to share the guilt .\nWe have to share the responsibility .\nAnd we have to take on board certain risks ourselves in order to fulfil our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo I \u2019 d like the politicians to remind people of that , because that \u2019 s what they \u2019 ve been elected to do \u2013 to see the social contract is being properly transacted .\nAlastair : There \u2019 s an essential sense of contamination that pervades everything .\nYou see repeatedly people reacting with total vitriol to pictures of young people going to the park or the beach .\nHow do you transform a collective sense of contamination and sin into something productive ?\nPG : It \u2019 s very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do except remind people that that is not only puritanical , but misguided .\nBecause actually , the only way we can reduce the risk to the vulnerable people in the population is , for those of us who are able to acquire herd immunity , to do that .\nEven if there is a little bit of a risk .\nI \u2019 m 55 years old , there \u2019 s some slight risk out there .\nBut I would be willing to take that , just as I do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk I might die of flu , but I \u2019 m willing to take that risk , because I know that if I don \u2019 t then flu will appear as it did before , it will enter the population of immunologically naive individuals , and then there will be a high risk of infection which will have a disproportionate effect on the vulnerable sector of the population .\nMaybe the way to counter it now is to say , actually , not only is it a good thing for young people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that is almost their duty .\nIt \u2019 s a way of living with this virus .\nIt \u2019 s how we live with other viruses .\nFlu is clearly a very dangerous virus , but the reason we don \u2019 t see more deaths from flu every year is because , through herd immunity , the levels of infection are kept to as low a level as we can get .\nI think there is a way of living in a community where we do take some risk .\nWe do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We say , ok there \u2019 s a risk , we \u2019 ll take it , because if we didn \u2019 t take that risk we \u2019 d be living our lives in a way we don \u2019 t want to .\nMaggie : The expression \u201c herd immunity \u201d has entered the same realms as austerity and Brexit .\nIt has become a sort of danger word because of that whole debate at the very beginning .\nThe minute you say herd immunity , the popular newspapers say you want to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s just a technical term .\nIt \u2019 s just a technical term for the proportion of the population that needs to be immune in order to prevent the disease from spreading , which is the central concept in vaccinations .\nIt \u2019 s a fundamental epidemiological concept , which clearly has been subverted .\nI guess the fact it includes the word herd has made it easier .\nThe truth is that herd immunity is a way of preventing vulnerable people from dying .\nIt is achieved at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop that by preventing the vulnerable class in the process .\nIn an ideal situation , you would protect the vulnerable as best you can , let people go about their business , allow herd immunity to build up , make sure the economy doesn \u2019 t crash , make sure the arts are preserved , and make sure qualities of kindness and tolerance remain in place .\nWe live , it seems , in this state of terror .\nYes , international travel facilitates the entrance of contagion , but what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why don \u2019 t we get flu pandemics anymore ?\nBecause before 1918 there was not sufficient international travel or densities of individuals to keep flu on as the sort of seasonal thing it is now .\nPockets of non-immune people would build up , and then they would be ravaged .\nThat was the pattern until the end of the First World War .\nSince then , many of these diseases have become endemic .\nAs a result of which we are much more exposed to diseases in general and related pathogens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are much better off than we would be if we hadn \u2019 t had some sort of exposure to it .\nIf coronavirus had arrived in a setting where we had no coronavirus exposure before , we might be much worse off .\nIt also seems that in addition to protection against severe disease as a result of exposure to related coronaviruses , some fraction of us seem to be resistant to infection .\nThat \u2019 s just fantastic news , actually .\nHopefully that will be consolidated at a scientific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at how antibodies to seasonal coronaviruses can impact on protection against infection and disease .\nMaybe we will be able to build up a picture that will reassure the public that actually we are much better off having been exposed to related coronaviruses .\nWe are in a better place to fight off this infection than we actually thought .\nMutaz : Do you think we are overestimating the size of a potential second wave , or if there \u2019 s going to be one at all in London , given how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PG : There is no reason to be so confident , as many modellers are , that the proportion proposed is extremely small .\nWhat you see regularly in articles and opinion pieces is this idea that herd immunity has to be over 70 % at least and only 5 % of the population has been exposed .\nThat is still a possibility , but actually it \u2019 s a possibility within a very small part of the whole parameter space that we should be considering .\nThere is also the possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large swathe of the population has been exposed .\nSome have become immune , and therefore exhibit antibodies , or don \u2019 t because those antibodies have decayed .\nAnd some were resistant to start with .\nUnder those circumstances , no , we shouldn \u2019 t see a huge surge in infections in those regions like London and New York where we \u2019 ve had a major incidence of infection and death .\nMaggie : Would you like to see a national antibody testing regime ?\nPG : Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tests themselves are not perfect , and we now know that some people just don \u2019 t make the antibodies even though they \u2019 ve been infected , or if they make the antibodies they \u2019 re at such low levels that they \u2019 re below the cut-offs of the tests .\nKnowing all of that , I think we should still go out and produce a very fine map of what the exposure levels are .\nThat will help us allocate resources in the winter , when it \u2019 s very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that should happen and I don \u2019 t know why it hasn \u2019 t .\nAlastair : How can journalists do better when reporting crude statistics that often come out ?\nThe framing of it is so crucial , and what you see so many times is people misreport and exaggerate stats .\nPG : Yes , I think the reporting has done us no favours and continues to remain that way .\nOne of the things that I find very difficult is the focus on national statistics .\nAmong the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become greatly underscored .\nIt \u2019 s really become a guiding sentiment in this miserable mess .\nWe should have dealt from the outset with this pandemic as an international problem .\nInstead it was \u201c let \u2019 s lockdown my country , let me protect my citizens \u201d , which is incredibly individualistic .\nThese absurd comparisons between large countries and small countries .\nIt \u2019 s not a song contest , it \u2019 s just absolutely ridiculous .\nIt \u2019 s also very harmful .\nWhen you think of the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing the fact that the epidemic appears to be over in the north east and growing in the south west .\nWhy would you put them together ?\nThere \u2019 s no reason to lump a rise in cases in Arizona with everything else .\nAnd then finally the whole business of reporting cases , which is deeply problematic because it depends on how many people have been tested in the first place and where they \u2019 re being tested .\nI \u2019 m not saying journalists shouldn \u2019 t report case numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDeaths are deaths , but cases can be anything .\nObviously there \u2019 ll be some confusion , because this is a new virus and some of it is technical .\nBut these are simple things .\nYou could ask this question of a 10 year old .\nDo you think it \u2019 s right to compare the number of deaths in Brazil with those in Italy , and the ten year old would say \u201c I don \u2019 t think so \u201d .\nAlastair : What can states do better ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries doing a national quarantine in the past .\nYou can think of cities or ships\u2026 PG : There \u2019 s that village of Eyam which locked down during the plague to stop the plague from exiting .\nNow that \u2019 s a decent reason to lockdown .\nTo lockdown to keep something out is highly individualistic .\nTo lockdown to keep something under control is , in the long term , quite misguided .\nMaggie : Would you have kept the lockdown purely to care homes ?\nPG : Certainly .\nShielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong .\nI think nations should follow both in the practical recommendations and the rhetoric of Sweden .\nThey made the decision , and it was presented without the hubris of \u201c this is the right thing to do \u201d .\nThey could have protected the care homes better perhaps , and we can \u2019 t get all of these things right , but we should try our best to shield the vulnerable .\nA certain degree of humility and logical dialogue about this might have prevented the whole nation from being paralysed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even with the measures easing , you can see that that terror has not dissipated .\nAlastair : So you think that the New Zealand approach , eradicating the virus , is both functionally silly and also immoral ?\nPG : Well , I don \u2019 t know whether I \u2019 d go so far as to say it \u2019 s immoral .\nIt seems to be very short-sighted , how can it possibly keep the virus out ?\nI think the smugness , the self-congratulation with which it \u2019 s presented is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous .\nIf it turns out that the rest of the world , through herd immunity or vaccination , manages to reduce the risk of infection , then what New Zealand will have done would be tantamount to not vaccinating your own child .\nJust waiting for everyone else to vaccinate their children and then go \u201c ok it \u2019 s all safe now \u201d .\nMutaz : At the start of the crisis , some epidemiologists seemed more concerned about predicting deaths than working out immunity .\nDo you think some public-facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear in an unreasonable way ?\nPG : You could argue that was the worst case scenario , and they felt that that was what they needed to present to the government .\nAfter that , there was no further consideration .\nThe debate was interrupted .\nAny attempt that I made to keep that debate alive and to try and get the right data on board to make decisions , was essentially ignored .\nAnd if anything , we came up for a lot of censure , and we were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really rather heartbreaking because right from the beginning we \u2019 ve all been very concerned about the effects of lockdown on underprivileged people , both in this country and globally .\nSo it hurts when we \u2019 re told we \u2019 re doing something dangerous .\nAlastair : How is epidemiology developed in different parts of the world .\nIs there a British approach , is there a diversity within epidemiology ?\nPG : There are some schools of thought , it \u2019 s true .\nWhat has come to prominence during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemiology , where you use mathematical and computer models to predict what \u2019 s going to happen .\nThe school of thought I

has become one painful slow-motion train wreck .\nThis week , it just got worse ( as if that was even possible , but ineptitude and corruption always find a way confound even the worst skeptics ) .\nJust last week , we learned that Public Health England ( PHE ) has been counting people who died of natural causes as \u201c COVID deaths \u201d simply because they had previously tested positive for the coronavirus at some point in the past ( meaning you can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is just one example of many administrative techniques used by governments to \u2018 cook the books \u2019 in order to inflate their COVID numbers in order to drive increasingly aggressive emergency policies , masks and their vaccine agenda .\nThe real truth of the matter is that many more people already have died , and will continue suffer due to the government \u2019 s disastrous lockdown policies \u2013 many more than have ever ( or will ever ) die from COVID-19 .\nThis is no mere opinion , this is demonstrably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What \u2019 s worse , the UK Government chose to ignore its own internal report from April which predicted massive deaths due to reactionary Lockdown policies .\nThis can only mean we are witnessing a complete breakdown in competence and functioning of the apparatus of government .\nIn his piece entitled \u201c The fatal cost of lockdown , \u201d Rob Lyons from Spiked Online explains\u2026 \u201c This week , the Telegraph reported on a government study , published in April , which estimated both the short-term and long-term impacts of lockdown .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reduce the number of cases of Covid-19 , the collateral damage would be enormous .\nSo was lockdown worth it ?\nThe report , produced by the Department of Health , the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) , the government \u2019 s Actuary Department and the Home Office , concluded that the disease itself would kill 50,000 , but delayed healthcare would kill 12,000 to 25,000 in the short term and 185,000 people in the long term .\nOn top of that , recession could kill anywhere between 600 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , domestic violence about 20 , and accidents at home would cause deaths in the \u2018 low tens \u2019 .\nIn short , perhaps 200,000 people or more could die as a result of the lockdown , according to these estimates.\n\u201d So while Boris Johnson \u2019 s government was so eager early on to heed Imperial College and Prof. Neil Ferguson \u2019 s \u2018 worst case scenario \u2019 of 500,000 COVID deaths , these same government experts completely ignored what turned out to be accurate ( if not completely underestimated ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown policies .\nWhat \u2019 s worse , the lockdown death total will continue to rise while the UK government continues to keep its NHS closed to regular patients , still running the pantomime of a \u2018 COVID only \u2019 health service .\nConversely , author also warned about the government \u2019 s over reliance on computer modelling to provide an illusion of certainty of likely outcomes : \u201c Moreover , these government estimates will have been produced using models , which must always be treated with caution .\nNot only are models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society works \u2014 they also make assumptions about fatality rates , speed of viral spread , the effectiveness of screening programmes for cancer and more that may or may not be particularly accurate.\n\u201d After four months , it is now easy to so that there are many fatal flaws in how the government and health officials began handling the coronavirus crisis \u2013 mistakes that continue to this day , and which will no doubt continue to be compounded so long as officials fail to acknowledge their own gross errors from the onset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit you got it wrong , but it seems these days that \u2019 s the one thing politicians are not prepared to do .\nIt would be too devastating to both their egos and lavish political careers .\nHence , the people will continue to suffer because of the corrupt vapidity of this political class .", "author": "21wire", "url":

his status as the first popularly elected President of the Republic ) and his Justice and Development Party ( or AKP ) have for the whole of the 21st century ( with the notable exception of this millennium when the party had not yet been founded ) .\nErdo\u011fan and his AKP henchmen have even ushered in what they call the New Turkey \u2013 as they like to call the country in the aftermath of the introduction of measures in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of Sunnification .\nThis denomination primarily functions to distinguish AKP-led Turkey from Kemalist Turkey ( 1923-2002 ) , a country built upon the principle of nationalism and contingent upon the idea that progress and modernisation are but a natural consequence of Westernisation .\nStill , this supposedly \u2018 new \u2019 political entity \u2013 the New Turkey \u2013 is very much hinged on the nation state Turkey that emerged following the end of the Great War ( aka World War I , 1914-18 ) and the Turkish War of Liberation ( 1919-22 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemal Pa\u015fa ( 1881-1938 ) .\nThe latter war was concluded by the Treaty of Lausanne that was signed on 24 July 1923 , and less than three months later , Mustafa Kemal ( later universally known as Atat\u00fcrk ) established the Republic of Turkey on the ruins of the Ottoman State ( 29 October 1923 ) .\nAnd that means that the centenary is but three years away now \u2013 1923-2023 .\nBut this year , in 2020 \u2013 that strange and awkward time frame when the world , including the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the coronavirus hysteria and its deadly companion known only as Covid-19 \u2013 the 97th anniversary of the signing of this legal document was marked by another anniversary and another momentous event .\nFor the Ayasofya Museum was turned into a mosque again on that very day this year .\nThe Hagia Sophia ( or the Church of the Holy Wisdom , dedicated on 26 December 537 ) , was originally built by Emperor Justinian ( 527-65 ) .\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople ( 29 May 1453 ) , the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orders of Sultan Mehmed II ( popularly knows as Fatih or the Conqueror , 1451-81 ) .\nAnd 86 years ago , this mosque had become a museum as a result of Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s personal intervention .\nThis year , on the very day that commemorates the signature of a treaty Kemalists used to call the Turkish Republic \u2019 s \u201c foundation document , \u201d the mosque that Fatih inaugurated became a living and breathing Muslim place of worship once again .\nThe Islamist Perspective : Mustafa Kemal as the Enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to point out that Islamists , and particularly Turkish ones , love to hate Atat\u00fcrk .\nAnd in the present context , the status of the Ayasofya as a museum ( 1934-2020 ) acts as nothing but an architectural and institutional symbol of Turkey \u2019 s founding father \u2013 a building and an institution that have come to encapsulate all the disgust and hatred felt by Turkish Islamists for the figure loved and adored by millions throughout the years .\nFor , the Mosque of Ayasofya occupied a special spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worship where the Ottoman Sultan himself attended Friday Prayers , as the one Imperial Mosque that had not been built by an Ottoman patron but that had instead been acquired by sheer force and violence ( summarised in the Turkish phrase K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Hakk\u0131 , that can be translated as the \u2018 Right of the Sword \u2019 ) .\nAs a result , in Ottoman times , the population looked to the Ayasofya for guidance , where the sermons delivered on Fridays carried special meaning , as the figure of the preacher had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to a member of the brotherhood ( or Tarikat ) of the Halvetiyye , favoured by the House of Osman and characterised by its adherence to the Sharia and the example of the Prophet ( the Sunnah ) .\nIn other words , this building that had been a church for 916 ( 537-1453 ) years had become a living and breathing embodiment of Ottoman Islam ( 1453-1934 or 481 years ) .\nAnd Atat\u00fcrk summarily brought an end to that sacred tradition .\nThe conversion of the Ayasofya was but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to outright hatred and revulsion .\nFollowing its foundation , the Turkish Republic quickly tried very hard to rid itself of any and all ill-smelling Ottoman remains and other supposedly sickly whiffs emanating from Muslim habits and institutions : on 1 November 1922 , ( following the conclusion of the War of Independence [ 1919-22 ] and prior to the foundation of the Republic even ) , the Turkish Parliament ( or TBMM , that had been supervising the war effort ) abolished the sultanate and two years later , in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined the caliphate to the dustbin of history as well ( 3 March 1924 ) .\nThis last suppression also included the abrogation of the Ministry of Pious Endowments and the office of \u015eeyh\u00fclslam ( the Sheikh-ul-Islam or head of the religious institution in the Ottoman State who oversaw the B\u00e2b-\u0131 Me\u015f\u00eehat ) only to replace the latter with a Directorate of Religious Affairs ( colloquially known as the Diyanet ) .\nThe next year , dervish brotherhoods ( called Tarikat and somewhat analogous to Christian orders , such as the Dominicans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ottoman headgear called Fes ( introduced by Mahmud II in 1828 ) joined the ranks of discarded institutions and items .\nInstead now , the government and its officials started encouraging the wholesale adoption of Western-style clothing , including hats , and not just for men but also for women .\nAnd this meant that the Turkish state ended up promoting a termination of the Islamic custom of veiling women and segregating the sexes .\nThe people by and large either enthusiastically adapted to these changes or merely acquiesced .\nBut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just say Islamists or purists ) were particularly upset by 1924 \u2019 s abolition of the Caliphate , for loyalty to the Caliph in Istanbul had been the rallying cry to unite Anatolia \u2019 s divergent Muslim population groups in the fight against the occupiers ( 1919-22 ) .\nYet now , now that the war was won , Mustafa Kemal turned against his erstwhile patron and deprived Muslims worldwide of their one and only spiritual figurehead : on 4 January 1925 , the Naqshbandi Sheikh Said issued a fetva against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republic \u2013 the fetva accused Mustafa Kemal of destroying religion and made it incumbent upon every believer to take up arms against the godless government in Ankara .\nAs these events had taken place in the remote southeast of the country ( largely occupied by Kurds , which is why many Kurds and Kurdophiles alike see this rising as linked to Kurdish nationalism rather than religious sentiment ) , the TBMM only became aware of the rising by late February .\nThe Naqshi-led rebels were by that stage threatening the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amed ) , and as a consequence the government dispatched the army to suppress the insurrection , leading to approximately 20,000 casualties .\nOn 27 April 1925 , the Turkish army captured the ringleader .\nAlready on the 4th of March , the TBMM had promulgated the \u2018 Law on the Maintenance of Order \u2019 ( or Takrir-i S\u00fckun Kanunu ) , re-established the so-called \u2018 Independence Tribunals \u2019 ( \u0130stiklal Mahkemeleri , originally set up on 26 September 1920 as part of the ongoing war effort ) .\nOn 28 June 1925 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheikh Said and 47 of his accomplices to death .\nThe executions were carried out the next day .\nAs a side-note , it is worth remarking that Ankara \u2019 s current AKP-led government has renamed Diyarbak\u0131r \u2019 s town square , the \u015eeyh Said Meydan\u0131 and , much more ominously , one should note that the current political elite ruling the country and its whole political apparatus has its roots firmly lodged deep inside the Naqshbandi organisation .\nThe Takrir-i S\u00fckun Kanunu ( or \u2018 Law on the Maintenance of Order \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 .\nThis meant that the Republic of Turkey was effectively governed by an emergency legislation for the duration of four years .\nAnd , as I have stated elsewhere , in \u201c these four years the most drastic reforms were introduced by the government.\n\u201d Following the disappearance of the institution of the Caliphate and its last incumbent ( Halife Abd\u00fclmecid Efendi , 1868\u20131944 ) \u2019 s expulsion from the country , the Ankara government clearly felt more at ease and proceeded to abolish Sharia law in 1926 .\nIn the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law codex regulating human actions and social relations with the so-called Kanun-\u0131 Medini , itself a copy of the Swiss Code civil .\nAlso in 1926 , Turks ( or rather Muslim citizens ) also received legal access to alcohol , a gesture that ensured that Turks could now enjoy delights reserved for the next world to other Muslims .\nIn the next world ( or Cennet or Paradise ) , the consumption of wine is allowed and even encouraged .\nThe Quranic Sura XLVII:15 speaks of the rivers of Paradise , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drinkers \u2019 .\nThe following year , the government ordered the removal of Ottoman tu\u011fra \u2019 s ( calligraphic imperial cyphers ) from public buildings ( 5 May 1927 ) .\nOn 1 November 1928 , then , the Arabic script was officially replaced by a new Latin-based alphabet .\nIn the same year , Turkish lawmakers also proceeded to amend the Constitution , in place since 1924 , by means of removing the phrase \u2018 The Religion of the Turkish State is Islam \u2019 from its second article .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their state religion ( a conceptual twosome expressed in the commonly used Ottoman phrase Din \u00fc Devlet or \u2018 Religion and State \u2019 ) from public view .\nIn the first years of the 1930s , the final finishing touches were put into place : the call to prayer and all Quranic recitations were to be executed in Turkish ( 1933 , this custom was abolished in 1950 with the advent of the Demokrat Parti , following the introduction of multi-party democracy ) ; next now largely unveiled Turkish women received the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , Sunday , the weekday Christians employ to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus by celebrating the Eucharist , became Turkey \u2019 s legal weekly holiday , taking the place of the Muslim holy day of Friday .\nIn short .\n\u201c the Kemalist reforms literally altered the face of Turkey , \u201d as expressed by the eminent historian Erik Z\u00fcrcher .\nIn Ottoman times , Turkey ( as the \u2018 Ottomans \u2019 cherished homeland \u2019 was called by \u2018 nearly everybody , \u2019 attested by K\u00e2z\u0131m Nami [ Duru ] , 1876-1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had looked like a typical Islamic country , with an abundance of veiled women , popular mosque attendance and the conspicuous absence of alcoholic beverages , among the most eye-catching Muslim sights .\nMustafa Kemal and his parliament also ensured that future generations of Turks would basically be cut off from their own history as well as from the nation \u2019 s historical record .\nIn addition , the newly introduced Latin alphabet would also make direct access to Islam \u2019 s holy book all but impossible .\nIn this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the introduction of surnames in 1934 ) had put conditions in place meant to secure Turkey \u2019 s further development as a nation state along Western lines .\nIn fact , in 1937 , the journalist \u00d6mer Kemal A\u011far ( 1901-87 ) proudly proclaimed that now \u201c there is no difference anymore between the European and us.\n\u201d And for that reason , Turkish Islamists ( traditionally called gerici or regressives adhering to irtica [ or religious reaction ] in Kemalist parlance ) despise Atat\u00fcrk , as they fully agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and condemn Turkey \u2019 s founding father as a veritable enemy of Islam .\nNow turning directly to the architectural and institutional symbol that has been the Ayasofya Museum for the past 86 years .\nFollowing the War of Liberation ( 1919-22 ) and the foundation of the Republic ( 1925 ) , the erstwhile church that Justinian built continued to operate as a mosque , as one of the many mosques dotting Istanbul \u2019 s urban landscape .\nIn Turkey , a great deal of conspiracy theories have been floated over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building suddenly became a museum \u2013 ranging from a forged Atat\u00fcrk signature to a geopolitical interpretation in the context of Soviet Russia and neighbouring Greece .\nThe reality though seems much more mundane and down to interpersonal relationships and interactions \u2013 between Atat\u00fcrk and Thomas Whittemore ( 1871-1950 ) , to be precise .\nThe latter was a Massachusetts-born American who has \u201c donned many hats throughout his life\u2014both literally and figuratively \u201d and whom the Harvard University research institute Dumbarton Oaks \u2019 website describes as an \u201c academic , amateur archaeologist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today best remembered \u201c for founding the Byzantine Institute , an organization that specialized in the study , restoration , and conservation of Byzantine art and architecture , in 1930.\n\u201d And more importantly , in June 1931 , his personal interaction with Mustafa Kemal led the Turkish government to grant the Institute permission to \u201c uncover and restore the original mosaics in Hagia Sophia , which had been covered in Islamic motifs since the church was converted into a mosque by the Ottoman Turks , in 1453.\n\u201d And in this context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdote : \u201c Santa Sophia was a mosque the day that I talked to him .\nThe next morning , when I went to the mosque , there was a sign on the door written in Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s own hand .\nIt said : \u2018 The museum is closed for repairs \u2019 .\n\u201d This short anecdote may very well be fanciful or aprocryphal , but following the American specialists \u2019 work on site , having uncovered hitherto quite unseen mosaics and frescoes , the then-Minister of Education Abidin \u00d6zmen ( 1890-1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogan ( 1888-1956 ) , the director of Istanbul \u2019 s Museums of Antiquities ( or \u00c2s\u00e2r-\u0131 Atika M\u00fczeleri , today Archaeology Musuems ) on 25 August 1934 \u2013 a letter instructing the latter to commence the arrangements to convert the mosque into a museum .\nIn the wake of these preparations , Turkey \u2019 s Council of Ministers ( then known as the Vekiller Heyeti ) officially desacralised the Ayasofya Mosque on 24 November 1934 .\nThis official document bears the signature of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk , in addition to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minipsters : These Kemalist politicians acted in accordance with their modernist beliefs that progress could only be achieved through modernisation as Westernisation , though the wording clearly shows they still considered Turkey to be part and parcel of the \u201c Oriental World \u201d ( \u2018 \u015eark alemi \u2019 ) .\nIt is also significant to point out that the Council of Ministers \u2019 document does not mention the Ayasofya \u2019 s extraordinary location in the Ottomans \u2019 religious life , instead specifically referring to \u201c this mosque \u201d as a \u201c work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byzantines.\n\u201d Rather than regarding or classifying the building as housing a living and breathing house of worship , as Atat\u00fcrk and his ministers had already effectively confined the Ottomans to the past as veritable museum pieces , they understood the Ayasofya ( or the Hagia Sophia ) solely as an impressive work of art that had been created by the \u201c Byzantines , \u201d and latterly appropriated by the Ottomans for their own purposes .\nIn this way , they clearly regarded their \u201c conversion of the Ayasofya mosque .\n.\n.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ befitting a modern and forward-looking state , a state not hampered by religious superstition or backward-looking beliefs and practices .\nFrom Mosque to Museum to Tourist Attraction Conservative Turks and Islamist opponents of the Ankara regime took Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s action regarding the most important mosque in the erstwhile Ottoman lands as a personal affront .\nRather than seeing this as a natural progression towards a modern and contemporary society , the Ayasofya conversion came to signify the extent to which Mustafa Kemal had led his people astray , away from the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or a\u1e63-\u1e62ir\u0101\u1e6d al-mustaq\u012bm or the s\u0131r\u00e2t-\u0131 m\u00fcstak\u00eem ) .\nAs a result , the issue of the Ayasofya was to become a festering wound over time , a constant source of grief and anger for many pious Turks and even zealous Muslims abroad .\nBut in the West , these concerns seemed very unreal , and the museum quickly became a popular tourist attraction .\nAs a building complex , the Ayasofya had accrued a lot Ottoman additions over the years , with the building of a number of domed tombs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( \u015fad\u0131rvan ) the most visible elements that the government was not able to either hide or erase .\nEqually , on the inside , the giant roundells bearing calligraphic rendition of the names of the Prophet and the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs , added in the 19th century , were not removed either .\nBut , on the whole , following the conversion to a museum , the church that Justinian built was basically returned to its original form : the \u201c present edifice is essentially that of Justinian \u2019 s reign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide Strolling through Istanbul , first published in 1972 .\nThe contemporary Byzantine chronicler Procopius of Caesarea ( ca 500-70 ) wrote down the following impression : In the next decade , UNESCO , a

in Turkey , and the charismatic and hugely popular Islamist Necmetin Erbakan ( 1926-2011 ) craftily employed the mention of the Ayasofya as a rallying cry to rouse the masses during his always more than well-attended public speeches .\nFollowing the sudden electoral victory of his Refah Partisi ( or RP , erroneously translated as Welfare Party ) in 1994 on a nationwide local level , the topic of reverting the museum into a mosque anew became a lively and widely debated topic of discussion in Turkey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the RP Mayor of Istanbul ( 27 March 1994 ) and the following day , the start of the working week or Monday , small groups of young men ostentatiously dressed up in Islamic garb could be seen congregating in front of the Ayasofya Museum , talking to passers-by and attempting to convince them that the building should become a mosque again .\nAs the fist Islamist Mayor of Istanbul , Erdo\u011fan was not shy about starting a charm campaign to impress Muslims worldwide .\nThe self-styled \u2018 magazine of Muslims around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent their reporter Mohammad Al-Abbasi to conduct an interview with the then-rising start of political Islam in Turkey , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( published on 26 April 1994 ) .\nIn the course of the conversation , the newly-appointed Mayor of Istanbul told the reporter that \u201c the Ayasofya will return as a mosque for Muslims.\n\u201d In other words , the topic may not always have been on the forefront of news cycles or in the public discourse of the land , but the fire of hatred that Atat\u00fcrk had unleashed kept burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anniversary of the Treaty of Lausanne : The Restoration of the Ayasofya It took Tayyip Erdo\u011fan 26 years to exact his revenge on Atat\u00fcrk , but in the end he kept

The longing of our nation , which has turned into a heartbreak , is coming to an end today.\n\u201d He then took a scenic route only to end his words with a deadly insult and curse : Dr Ali Erba\u015f

founding father \u2019 s most popular and oft-repeated phrases employs the same word , a word that is not at all in common usage anymore in contemporary Turkey : \u201c One day my mortal body will turn to dust , but the Turkish Republic will stand forever [ or ilelebet ] .\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ayasofya Mosque , as a symbol for the AKP-led New Turkey , will remain forever , while

transform the nation state Turkey into an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities , possibly linked to a revived caliphate \u201d and the renewed implementation of Sharia law .\nAnd in the aftermath of the re-dedication , Islamist publications in Turkey have immediately jumped on this scenario , particularly on the possibility that the Prez could now rightfully claim a new and truly

and medical \u201c experts \u201d have been in abundance , primarily regurgitating the same message as though it was something new every time they get interviewed : wash your hands , maintain social distancing , and wear a mask as much as possible .\nAnd the public and the news media always take great comfort that an \u201c expert \u201d told them the truth .\nTrouble is , you can always find another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will offer a completely contradictory perspective .\nUnderstandably , this generates much of the fear and confusion noted above .\nThe good hygiene and virus avoidance advice noted above is helpful , although it is probably a bit overblown when discussing how important a mask is in preventing virus transmission , especially outdoors .\nIt seems ludicrous to mandate mask wearing at all times , indoors and outdoors , although this is being given consideration by some governmental ( and medical ) authorities at the time of this writing .\nHowever , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the numerous options available to avoid contracting this infection , or to even cure it .\nThere is no point in suffering from misguided advice when COVID-19 can be prevented or reliably cured in short order .\nAs will be clearly explained in this article , nobody needs to die from COVID-19 , or even to suffer needlessly ( as many virus victims have remained quite ill for months before finally recovering ) .\nWhile still unknown to most practitioners of traditional , or \u201c modern \u201d medicine , acute viral syndromes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily prevented most of the time .\nAnd when such viruses do get a foothold in the body , they are still easily eradicated if the patient is not too close to death before receiving any of a large number of treatments established to be effective .\nMany doctors get attacked for promoting treatments as cures for afflictions that are traditionally considered to be incurable .\nCertainly , it is true that some treatments promoted as being reliable cures are either fraudulent or of only nominal benefit .\nHowever , failing to assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical condition is just as detrimental to the health of an ailing patient as it is promoting a false cure .\nMany doctors know of highly beneficial treatments that cure or vastly improve medical conditions that are little affected by traditional therapies .\nYet , fear of license revocation for telling the truth about inexpensive and natural therapies that can not be protected by patents keeps most health care practitioners from promoting those beneficial therapies .\nNothing is ever embraced , and seemingly not even permitted , that would take away large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even many of the doctors themselves .\nWhenever you are absolutely stupefied and can not figure out why a valuable treatment is not being used , just take the time to identify , expose , and analyze the money trail that is involved with the prescription drugs and/or overall treatment protocol that would be displaced .\n[ 1 ] The reason for the avoidance or suppression of that therapy will then become apparent .\nTo be perfectly clear : The health of the patient must always be the primary concern whenever rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment right in the United States that permits free speech , including the writing of books and articles .\nThis right has even protected authors that openly provide information on how to make bombs and promote terrorism .\nOne can only hope that discussing inexpensive and effective medical treatments will continue to receive the same protection .\nHowever , it is very clear that this right is rapidly disappearing , in light of the open suppression of free speech that has been occurring for some time , but especially in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the information in this article is being presented .\nThere already exist numerous ways to reliably prevent , mitigate , and even cure COVID-19 , including in late-stage patients who are already ventilator-dependent .\nSome of the modalities have already been proven to work , although not in the classic \u201c prospective double-blind , placebo-controlled trials \u201d conducted on hundreds to thousands of patients .\nA perceptive clinician realizes that one overwhelmingly impressive case report where an agent or intervention promptly and unequivocally reverses the condition of a rapidly declining patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dismissed and disparaged as anecdotal and irrelevant .\nFurthermore , it is the existence of such cases and unequivocally positive responses that makes it completely unethical to put other patients into placebo-controlled trials when the treatment is dramatically beneficial to most patients and harmless to all .\nAllowing patients in the placebo group to suffer greatly and even die under such circumstances can never be justified .\nUnfortunately , even when multiple scientifically-sound clinical studies actually do get conducted and reported on inexpensive , nontoxic , and highly effective therapies , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many examples of such therapies , an especially noteworthy example of the suppression of good medicine is seen with vitamin C. The continued avoidance of the use of intravenous vitamin C , especially in septic patients in the intensive unit , [ 2 ] stands out as a clear example of flagrant malpractice .\nConservatively , thousands of ICU patients around the world , on a daily basis , would be saved or at least spared substantial suffering with a simple protocol utilizing intravenous vitamin C. And the morbidity and mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the ICU setting would also be readily mitigated and even resolved with vitamin C-based protocols .\nBut this is not happening , even though the literature has unequivocally indicated the clinical importance ( and safety ) of vitamin C for over 80 years .\n[ 3 ] The following therapies can be used , and many have been used , to prevent and treat COVID-19 ( and many other infections , viral or otherwise ) .\nNot all of them have been equally well-documented or proven as being effective .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clinical support .\nOthers represent simply logical applications of treatment protocols that have already been proven to be highly effective in eradicating other viral infections and should be expected to have comparable effects on the COVID-19 virus .\nThe treatments described below are categorized as having the ability to prevent , to improve and to cure COVID-19 and other viral syndromes\u2026 Read more of this article by Thomas E.

away , President Trump put forward the idea of delaying the November 3rd US presidential election , casting doubt over the integrity of the vote .\nAs expected , his social media move triggered the mainstream press , as well as Republican leaders in Congress , who immediately opposed the notion that the election may need to be held back due to the prospect of having polls closed on the day due to COVID fears , thus leaving most Americans no other option but to mail-in their votes .\nDespite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detractors on Capitol Hill , the President refused to back down from his idea of postponing the November general election , citing concerns of a potential for massive voter fraud , claiming that excessively large numbers of mail-in ballots could mean that \u201c you never even know who won the election.\n\u201d \u201c With Universal Mail-In Voting ( not Absentee Voting , which is good ) , 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history , \u201d Trump wrote on Twitter in the morning .\n\u201c It will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Election until people can properly , securely and safely vote ?\n?\n?\n\u201d This of course drew cries from media and political opposition of rump \u2019 s creeping towards \u2018 fascism \u2019 , even though the President is not actually constitutionally to enforce any such decision .\nStill , the President continued : While the media performed its usual reactionary frenzy in the 24 hours following Trump \u2019 s initial outburst , as reality on the issue began to set in , it slowly became clear to those who were seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social distancing and \u201c COVID safety \u201d policies to dictate the terms of a general election in the United States .\nThe Washington Post soon admitted what the White House had already knew , announcing that the U.S .\nPostal Service was in fact experiencing long backlogs of mail across the country .\nIn typical partisan fashion , The Post goes on to try and blame systemic delays on \u201c a top Trump donor running the agency put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts , \u201d but the facts were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail-in vote for the general election will almost certainly end in disaster for the country \u2013 simply because they can not deliver all of the ballots in a timely manner for the November election .\nNor can they guarantee a timetable of the collections of votes afterwards .\nWhat other chaos might ensue during that time ?\nImagine if the electorate were forced to wait a month before the results were announced .\nAnd even then , the result will almost certainly be contested , and violently so \u2013 especially if the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trump is trailing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in all of major electoral polls .\nWill officials really allow the fear of COVID to end up determining the result of the election ?", "author": "21wire", "url":

the key problems with how the entire \u2018 lockdown \u2019 concept was conceived in the first place was the US and UK governments \u2019 over-reliance on computer-modeled projections and pandemic simulations .\nIt \u2019 s now known that almost all of these models turned out to be completely wrong and yet , the government still doubled-down on its policies based on these same false assumptions and corrupted data .\nRegarding the COVID crisis going forward , rather than casting their typical one-size-fits-all approach to public health policy , perhaps it would behoove governments to place the majority of weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the models might actually become useful .\nNot surprisingly , that crucial variable happens to be the one at-risk demographic which the government completely failed to protect since the beginning of the so-called \u2018 pandemic.\n\u2019 To be even more accurate , the real risk emerges when you combine old age with corresponding chronic long-term health conditions , also known as comorbidities .\nWhy are governments still refusing to admit this is the only real variable we should be concerned with ?\nAs an economist I am not happy about going into having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people die from Covid19 , but at least I can have a look at correlations .\nIt has been very clear for some time that very few people younger than 50 years old die from Covid19 .\nIn fact the average of people dying with Covid19 have been around 80 years in most countries and men are more likely to die than women .\nThese simple facts made me think \u2013 how much of this can explain the different mortality rates we observe across countries ?\nWhy has so many people died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been much lower in for example Scandinavia ?\nSimilarly why are mortality rates so low in most developing countries ?\nCan the age composition explain this ?\nThe graph below give us the answer .\nIn the graph I have plotted the number of deads with Covid19 per 1 million population versus the share of the male population older than 80 years ( % ) .\nThe data was collected on Friday April 17 2020 and I have only looked at countries with at least 100 deaths from Covid19 and excluded very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see there is a very strong correlation between the two and it is certainly strong enough for me to argue that the absolut most important variable determining whether or not a country will be hard hit or not by the Covid19 crisis is the the age structure in the country .\nCountries with a lot of old men will simply suffer a lot bigger blow than countries with younger populations .\nIt should of course be noted that I here compare countries , which are in different phases of the Covid19 crisis .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ model \u201d more ( or less ? )\nprecise and we could of course also add more variables \u2013 for example air pollution , which think also is an important factor , but what is notable is that age alone is such an important factor\u2026 Read more at the

of \u201c spikes \u201d in coronavirus \u201c cases , \u201d and are inferring that the state of emergency must continue because cases are \u2018 on the rise \u2019 in the UK .\nBut are these official

well-being of the nation ?\nAccording to some of the UK leading experts and epidemiologists , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty in a competent fashion .\nCarl Heneghan from the Center for Evidence Based Medicine ( CEBM ) at Oxford University reports\u2026 The government has restricted movements on millions of people in England : COVID is apparently on the rise .\nBut what happens when you start digging into the data .\nI have used the following data sets to piece together the number of tests , cases and results for Pillar 1* ( done in healthcare settings ) and Pillar 2* ( tests are done in the community ) .\nLooking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date the PCR test to detect the virus SARs-CoV-2 is reported , shows a trend for an increased number of cases detected \u2013 ( from about 500 to nearly 750 a day ) If you look at the data by the date the specimen is taken the trend is still apparent .\nNow all things being equal , the increase in cases is about 250 per day over a month \u2013 not an exponential rise , and no sudden jump .\nBut is this a real increase or could it be down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing explain the rise ?\nSee a time series of positive cases by specimen date : 31 July 2020 to look at the Pillar 1 , 2 cases detected .\nOn the 28th of July in England , Pillar 1 reported 64 cases , and Pillar 2 reports 512 cases ( 576 in total ) .\nYet www.gov.site reports on the same-day fewer cases \u2013 547 of the two combined .\nWhich one is , therefore right ?\nThis inaccuracy makes it difficult to make judgements as to what is happening on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the number of cases in Pillar 2 is trending up and Pillar 1 is trending down .\nThis would suggest that the increase in hospitals \u2013 in the sickest ( Pillar 1 ) \u2013 is staying the same ; while in the community Pillar 2 testing is picking up milder asymptomatic disease .\nHowever , what happens if you adjust for any change in testing over time ?\nOn the 1st of July \u2013 the seven day moving average of testing was 41,109 for Pillar 1 and 43,161 in Pillar 2 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 seven day average for testing had increased to 49,543 ( a 20 % increase ) ; while the Pillar 2 had risen by much more \u2013 by 82 % to 78,522 tests .\nThe next graph shows what happens when you adjust for the number of tests done and then standardise to per 100,000 tests .\nPillar 1 is seen to be still trending down , but Pillar 2 is now flatlining .\nThe increase in the number of cases detected is likely due to the increase in testing in Pillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the number of tests being done .\nLeicester and Oldham have seen significant increases in testing in a short time .\nLeicester , for example in the first two weeks of July did more tests than anywhere else in England : 15,122 tests completed in the two weeks up to 13th July .\nThe potential for false-positives ( those people without the disease who test positive ) to drive the increase in community ( Pillar 2 ) cases is substantial , particularly because the accuracy of the test and the detection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear .\nStandardising cases per tests done , and aligning the counts in different datasets to provide the same numbers will allow a better understanding of whether cases are going up or down .\nInaccuracies in the data and poor interpretation will often lead to errors in decisions about imposing restrictions ,

fast turning into a tragedy .\nThe issue of Democratic nominee Joe Biden \u2019 s frequent and increasingly noticeable gaffes has given way to the trending hashtag # CognitiveDecline .\nAnd it \u2019 s no longer laughing matter .\nAt the age of 77 , Biden is by far the oldest Presidential candidate in American history .\nIf he does manage to get elected in November , he would be 78 by the time of

veriable spring chicken in comparison to Biden .\nBy now , Trump \u2019 s constant stream of gaffes and invectives are widely written off as being the byproduct of extreme ignorance combined with a galactic narcissistic complex .\nBut Biden \u2019 s slippage is something else altogether , and looks like it could be genuine cerebral impairment .\nAs a result , his campaign is fast becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sad and almost macabre about it \u2013 how the party and its media adjuncts can allow such a disintegrating situation to carry on .\nIn all of his \u2018 virtual \u2019 campaign appearances , Biden has exhibited incoherent outbursts , and nonsensical ramblings , as well as an inability to finish sentences .\nThere isn \u2019 t very much to conclude here other than the Democratic Party \u2019 s choice of leadership seems to be experiencing a clear mental decay , not dissimilar to the early stage alzheimers according to some mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as if this situation has just sprung out of nowhere .\nBiden \u2019 s cognitive decline was visible from before the Democratic primaries .\nAs recently as late June , a national poll conducted by Rasmussen showed that nearly 40 percent of registered American voters believed that the former Vice President has \u201c some form of dementia.\n\u201d Whether this is actually the case or not is a question for his doctors , but the fact that so many Americans believe he is unfit should raise alarm bells for Democrats .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play .\nBased on his present mental performance , it \u2019 s possible that Biden may not be able to complete his first term in office , which means that whichever female he chooses as his Vice Presidential running mate \u2013 Susan Rice , Kamala Harris , Gretchen Whitmer , or anyone else \u2013 could end up assuming the office of US President within 12 months .\nThat means that the election in November is not Trump vs Biden , but rather Trump vs Biden \u2019 s VP pick .\nThis realization alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if Biden \u2019 s back-up really has no real mandate at all to sit at the helm of chief executive of the country .\nHow long until the mainstream media and Democratic Party leadership ( or the Biden campaign itself ) openly address this potentially unstable situation ?\nColumnist Miranda Devine from the New York Post writes\u2026 He might be riding high in the polls , but Joe Biden \u2019 s mental acuity increasingly is an issue in the election campaign , and growling at reporters who ask about it is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during an event with the National Associations of Black and Hispanic Journalists if he had \u201c taken a cognitive test , \u201d Biden snapped .\n\u201c No , I haven \u2019 t taken a test !\nWhy the hell would

nerve , and Biden \u2019 s flash of anger was a reminder of his interview in May with a black man , radio host Charlamagne tha God , when Biden blurted out the ruinous line that if you vote for Trump , \u201c you ain \u2019 t black.\n\u201d This time , Biden \u2019 s startling go-to defense was to accuse a black man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Biden appeared to look at something slightly to the left of the camera , suddenly laughed heartily , apropos of nothing , and nodded his head twice .\nMaybe a staffer was frantically waving cue cards behind the camera or flashing a warning through the teleprompter .\nWhatever was going on , Biden recovered his composure and delivered a sharp line about President Trump and the cognitive test the commander-in-chief recently boasted about acing .\n\u201c If he [ Trump ] can \u2019 t figure out the difference between an elephant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the hell he \u2019 s talking about , \u201d says Biden .\nPhew , crisis averted .\nOr it would have been

is going on in Biden \u2019 s brain .\nIt seemed obvious to anyone on the ground at the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary that Biden \u2019 s energy and cognitive function were fading .\nIt is the great mystery of the 2020 campaign why , with such a field of vibrant young talent to choose from , the Democratic establishment fell in behind a frail 77-year-old to pit against Trump , who despite the pandemic and crippled economy remains a formidable campaigner .\nMake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen by popular acclaim .\nHe was anointed by the Democratic Party \u2019 s new kingmaker , Barack

How COVID is Accelerating Facial Recognition Payment Systems", "content": "Undoubtedly , one of the biggest social engineering agenda items that \u2019 s being aggressively pushed by the Establishment in the wake of the COVID crisis \u2013 is the dubious idea that society must now go \u2018 cashless \u2019 in order to stop the spread of coronavirus and \u2018 save lives.\n\u2019 As a result , various applications for contactless payments are now being adopted , including a new system which uses your face as your ID .\nHow did we get here so fast ?\nThe concept of the cashless society has been nudged along for decades , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , and like most crisis-driven narratives , it was propelled by fake news .\nInitially , the official conspiracy theory was drifted out into the global information space by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and was based on early unconfirmed reports coming out of China which western mainstream media were eager to latch on to .\nThe suspicions were groundless , but due to an atmosphere of fear which was being fostered by the WHO and others , this false idea of cash being a vector for a deadly virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western consumers and vendors alike .\nIt should also be noted that the single biggest funder of WHO is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ( nearly $ 400 million per year ) , and Bill Gates \u2019 s Microsoft empire is one of the lead developers in both new facial recognition and \u2018 universal \u2019 digital ID systems .\nAlso , in 2012 , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation help start a global initiative to phase out cash called , Better Than Cash .\nIt would be disingenuous to say there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current \u2018 pandemic \u2019 and \u2018 New Normal \u2019 social engineering arenas .\nSince then , WHO have come under fire from critics , and recently a spokeswoman was forced to walk-back the wild claim which had previously gone viral in March after appearing in a widely cited article in the U.K. media with the unsubstantiated claim that , \u201c banknotes may be spreading the new coronavirus \u201d and \u201c customers should wash their hands after touching banknotes because infectious Covid-19 may cling to the surface for a number of days.\n\u201d \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitting coronavirus , \u201d WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told MarketWatch .\n\u201c We were misrepresented , \u201d she said .\nBut it was too late .\nThe mind virus has already spread around the planet , with shops and businesses now using this false idea to advertise how they would no longer accept cash on the basis that it somehow posed a threat to public health .\nTechnology writers at MIT also stated their reservations and remarked that , \u201d \u2026 the truth is , there isn \u2019 t much evidence that quitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in the case of Covid-19.\n\u201d \u201c You \u2019 re more likely to pick up Covid-19 from people exposure than from the type of payment.\n\u201d More interestingly , following the upswell of Black Lives Matter street protesters , \u2018 woke \u2019 corporate boards from top tech firms like Microsoft and IBM \u2013 all placed a moratorium on selling their latest facial recognition technology software to police departments .\nMoreover , in this current \u2018 pandemic \u2019 environment , and as with most shoppers \u2013 many of these same protesters are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only expect to see even more advanced facial recognition or digital ID systems where an individual could be ID \u2019 s digitally \u2013 even while wearing a face covering .\nRegardless , this latest drive for more \u2018 convenience \u2019 ( supposedly to \u2018 save time waiting in line \u2019 ) should be viewed as another level of corporate and state surveillance of the individual \u2013 and part of the relentless drive to completely eliminate anonymous transactions forever .\nThis new method of payment does not yet have a brand name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something marketable and socially ubiquitous , like \u201c Face Pay \u201d \u2026 A new way to pay has arrived in Los Angeles : your face .\nAs so-called contactless payments rise in popularity during the pandemic , a Pasadena company called PopID is rolling out the nation \u2019 s first payment system based on facial recognition at a smattering of restaurants near its headquarters , including mom-and-pop operations such as Daddy \u2019 s Chicken Shack and regional chains such as Lemonade .\nThe system is simple : A customer signs up on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash to their Pop Pay account from a credit card or bank account .\nWhen it comes time to pay for their meal , they look into the camera of a PopID tablet or kiosk ( no smiling necessary ) , the cashier verifies their name , and money is withdrawn from the account .\nFor customers , the experience is eerily seamless , at least when it \u2019 s functioning properly .\n( The software struggles at recognizing faces with masks . )\nFor restaurants , the service is fast and cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEasier ordering can speed up lines , and PopID is offering lower fees to process each payment than other payment processing or credit card companies .\nIn China , more than 100 million people signed up for a similar face payment system in 2019 after 7-Eleven installed it at hundreds of locations , tech giant Alipay is rolling out face payments across the country , and , since July , commuters in the southern city of Guiyang have been able to pay their bus fare using their face .\nBut PopID \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and running in the U.S. , where facial recognition technology is under intense scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates .\nEight cities in the U.S. , including San Francisco , Oakland and Boston , have banned government use of the technology , arguing that the software is both too powerful a surveillance tool and too inaccurate when finding matches to be safely used by police .\nDuring the nationwide protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , Microsoft , IBM and Amazon all committed not to sell their facial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least temporarily .\nAnd Portland , Ore. , may soon

and Texas .\nThe figure plots the daily number of deaths per million population .\nThis figure illustrates the rise and fall of deaths from covid-19 in four different policy environments .\nThe data were obtained from Worldometer .\nSweden ( blue dots ) has served as a control group to compare policies intended to decrease deaths from covid-19 .\nSweden has been unfairly criticized for its policy despite having an outcome more favorable than places with authoritarian lockdown policies .\nSweden did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping gatherings of more than fifty people , the Swedish government left decisions of closing businesses , using masks , and social distancing to the Swedish people .\nThe government encouraged the use of masks and social distancing , but there were no requirements and there were no penalties for those who declined to follow the advice .\nMortality attributed to covid-19 hit a peak value of 11.38 deaths per day per million population on April 8 , 2020 .\nThis mortality was matched on April 15 , and mortality has decreased since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one death per day per million population for the previous eighteen days .\nCases are very low .\nFor all practical purposes , the covid-19 epidemic is over in Sweden .\nAlmost certainly herd immunity has been achieved in Sweden irrespective of any antibody test results .\nTesting is usually only for IgG antibody and the herd can become immune via IgA antibody or cellular mechanisms that are not detected by the usual testing .\nWhether covid-19 will reappear this next fall or winter remains to be seen .\nNew York : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horse Has Already Left New York ( brown dots ) has been a catastrophe .\nOn March 20 , 2020 , a full lockdown was implemented .\nNonessential businesses were ordered to close .\nWorkers in nonessential businesses were ordered to work only from home .\nPharmacies , grocery stores , liquor stores , and wine stores were deemed to be essential and allowed to remain open .\nRestaurants and bars could only deliver to homes .\nIn addition to the lockdown , nursing homes were ordered on March 25 , 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus in transfer from hospitals .\nOn May 10 , this order was changed such that patients had to test negative for the virus before being transferred to nursing homes , but the damage had already been done .\nBy April 7 , 2020 , within three weeks of the nursing home order , a daily mortality of over fifty deaths per day per million population had been reached .\nThis daily mortality rate was almost five times the peak rate observed in Sweden , where no lockdown was implemented .\nIllinois ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sweden than does New York .\nIllinois also implemented a harsh lockdown on March 20 , 2020 .\nThere was no nursing home order as in New York .\nThe daily mortality rate increased more slowly than it did in New York and Sweden , reaching a peak of over fifteen deaths per day per million population on May 17 , 2020 .\nThe daily mortality has declined more slowly than it did in New York and Sweden , and it remains significantly higher than the rates in those places .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the lockdown did indeed slow the rate of transmission among the young and healthy but also allowed a longer time for transmission from young people to elderly people .\nThe lockdown appears to have made more deaths from covid-19 in Illinois than would have occurred without it .\nAlmost certainly herd immunity has not been achieved and will not be achieved until the schools and economy are reopened .\nTexas : The Ox Is Slow , but the Earth Is Patient Texas ( gold dots ) had very few deaths following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York and Illinois .\nNonessential businesses were closed on March 31 .\nOutdoor activities were permitted .\nSocial distancing was advised but not required .\nGovernor Abbott was criticized for not squeezing hard enough , but predictions that Texas health care would be overwhelmed by late April failed to materialize .\nTexas appeared to be a success story , with a much lower mortality , and the state began a phased reopening of the economy on May 1 , 2020 .\nSEE ALSO : Why Sweden Has Already Won the Debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late June , however , cases of covid-19 were increasing and the daily mortality rate was creeping up .\nThe general reopening was paused , and some relaxations of measures were rescinded on June 26 , 2020 .\nThe Texas daily mortality rate hit a peak of over ten deaths per day per million population on July 31 , 2020 .\nThe Texas mortality peak is almost bad as the peak rate seen in Sweden , but Texas still has a largely closed economy .\nTexans are debating whether schools should be reopened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about its schools , because it never closed its schools .\nTexas will eventually have to reopen its schools and economy .\nIt would appear that covid-19 deaths were deferred rather than prevented by the lockdown .\nAlthough the overall covid-19 mortality is lower in Texas ( 293 deaths per million population ) than in Sweden ( 570 ) , the current daily mortality in Texas is much higher than in Sweden , so covid-19 mortality in Texas may catch up to Sweden over the next 30\u201360 days .\nFurthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse when the schools and economy are reopened , as they eventually must be .\nLike the ox and the Earth , the lockdown slowed the transmission of the virus among the young and healthy , but the virus appears to be very patient and will spread when it is able to .\nThe data suggest that lockdowns have not prevented any deaths from covid-19 .\nAt best , lockdowns have deferred death for a short time , but they can not possibly be continued for the long term .\nIt seems likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare economic deprivation with loss of life , as the final death toll following authoritarian lockdowns will most likely exceed the deaths from letting people choose how to manage their own risk .\nAfter taking the unprecedented economic depression into account , history will likely judge these lockdowns to be the greatest policy error of this generation .\nCovid-19 is not going to be defeated ; we will have to learn how to coexist with it .\nThe only way we can learn how best to cope with covid-19 is to let individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes , and learn from mistakes .\nThe world owes a great debt to Sweden for setting an example that the rest of us can follow .\nGilbert Berdine is an associate professor of medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and an affiliate of the Free Market Institute at

on Monday in San Francisco Federal Court charging Facebook , Mark Zuckerberg , and three fact-checking outfits with censoring truthful public health posts and for fraudulently misrepresenting and defaming CHD .\nAccording to CHD \u2019 s Complaint , Facebook has insidious conflicts with the Pharmaceutical industry and its captive health agencies and has economic stakes in telecom and 5G .\nFacebook currently censors CHD \u2019 s page , targeting its purge against factual information about vaccines , 5G and public health agencies .\nFacebook acknowledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHO and the CDC .\nWhile earlier court decisions have upheld Facebook \u2019 s right to censor its pages , CHD argues that Facebook \u2019 s pervasive government collaborations make its censorship of CHD a First Amendment violation .\nThe government \u2019 s role in Facebook \u2019 s censorship goes deeper than its close coordination with CDC and WHO .\nThe Facebook censorship began at the suggestion of powerful Democratic Congressman and Intelligence Committee Chairman Representative Adam Schiff , who in March 2019 asked Facebook to suppress and purge internet content critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schiff use the term \u201c misinformation \u201d as a euphemism for any statement , whether truthful or not , that contradicts official government pronouncements .\nThe WHO issued a press release commending Facebook for coordinating its ongoing censorship campaign with public health officials .\nThat same day , Facebook published a \u201c warning label \u201d on CHD \u2019 s page , which implies that CHD \u2019 s content is inaccurate , and directs CHD followers to turn to the CDC for \u201c reliable , up to date information.\n\u201d This is an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government authority to openly censor unwanted critique of government Attorneys Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , Roger Teich , and Mary Holland represent Children \u2019 s Health Defense in the litigation .\nThe lawsuit also challenges Facebook \u2019 s use of so-called \u201c independent fact-checkers \u201d \u2013 which , in truth , are neither independent nor fact-based \u2013 to create oppositional content on CHD \u2019 s page , literally superimposed over CHD \u2019 s original content , about open matters of scientific controversy .\nTo further silence CHD \u2019 s dissent against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharmaceutical products , Facebook deactivated CHD \u2019 s donate button , and uses a variety of deceptive technology ( i.e .\nshadow banning ) to minimize the reach and visibility of CHD \u2019 s content .\nIn short , Facebook and the government colluded to silence CHD and its followers .\nSuch tactics are fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment , which guarantees the American public the benefits to democracy from free flow of information in the marketplace of ideas .\nIt forbids the government from censoring private speech\u2014particularly speech that criticizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes famously said , \u201c the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.\n\u201d The current COVID pandemic makes the need for open and fierce public debate on health issues more critical than ever .\nMark Zuckerberg publicly claims that social media platforms shouldn \u2019 t be \u201c the arbiters of truth.\n\u201d This case exposes Zuckerberg for working with the government to suppress and purge unwanted critiques of government officials and policies .\nThe court will decide whether Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false and misleading \u201c warning labels , \u201d deceptive \u201c fact-checks , \u201d and

possibly can.\n\u201d Earlier , in response to suggestions there would be community resistance to mandating it , Mr Morrison told 3AW the government had not yet made a firm decision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @

policies , driving the country and ts people even closer to full-blown medical martial law .\nThis week , Australian PM Scott Morrison was caught on record saying that COVID vaccines should be mandatory for all citizens , but was forced to backtrack on his statements after public outrage over his authoritarian statements .\nOne Sydney doctor is now openly advocating that the government suspend the rights of certain citizens by implementing a permanent travel ban covering both interstate and overseas movement \u2013 designed to target anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIMAGE : Dr Zac Turner

most of their normal rights as citizens until they are forced to be vaccinated \u2013 presumably under the power of the state \u2013 in the name of \u2018 public health.\n\u2019 He is adamant that any

which he says \u201c could easily be turned into electronic vaccine cards and offered to each Australian.\n\u201d Turner also believes that any dissenters should also be denied access to shops , gyms , cinemas , restaurants , bars and nightclubs .\n\u201c I believe a person who refuses to be vaccinated should not be allowed to travel interstate or overseas , nor be allowed to travel on public transport without a face mask .\nAnd when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could refuse these anti-vaxxers from visiting their retail outlets , gyms , movie cinemas , restaurants , bars or nightclubs , \u201d says Dr Zac Turner .\n\u201c As a precedence , state governments have previously banned children from attending childcare if they are not vaccinated .\nSimilar restrictions could be placed on Australians who refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccination , \u201d he adds .\nPerhaps not surprisingly , Turner is also former employee of vaccine firm AstraZeneca \u2013 the same company which has sewn-up a deal with the Australian government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone questioning the safety or efficacy of vaccines as \u201c clowns \u201d and believes they pose a direct threat danger to rest of the right-thinking citizens who will comply with government orders .\nDr Zac Turner is writing for News.com.au and says\u2026 With news of vaccines reaching their final stages and our government signing a deal to buy 25 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca , many of us are thinking with relief that it is all over .\nUnfortunately , it is not even close to halfway .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradicate the transmission of COVID-19 , Australia would need about 80 to 95 per cent of its population vaccinated , which in reality may take up until late next year .\nAnd a key element to achieving this is to convince everyone to get vaccinated \u2013 even those people who are the curse of the scientific community , anti-vaxxers .\nThat means 20 million Australians is the vaccination target .\nSince January , Australia has conducted 5,380,613 COVID-19 tests .\nTo achieve our target , we would need to double that number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .\nIt will be a landmark test of our country , and it will be a chapter in our history textbooks .\nOnce a vaccine is approved for general use , it will take a minimum of three to six months for it to be made available to the entire population of Australia .\nDuring this time , it could be difficult for authorities to determine who is an anti-vaxxer versus somebody who is yet to be offered the vaccine .\nThe government should consider updating the current \u201c yellow fever vaccination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinations before visiting high risk countries .\nThese could easily be turned into electronic vaccine cards and offered to each Australian .\nAt least 2 to 5 per cent of the Australian population can not be vaccinated due to health reasons , especially those with serious allergies .\nIt \u2019 s important to protect those who can \u2019 t be vaccinated by having everyone around them vaccinated \u2013 so it can not spread .\nThe next biggest threat to the virus is those who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19 .\nIn America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans would not get the vaccine even if it was readily available and affordable .\nThat \u2019 s startling enough to hear but we should recognise as a cultural extension of America , our population could not be too far off this as well .\nAustralia \u2019 s next obstacle will be getting people to be vaccinated .\nWe can not afford to be complacent .\nThe problem is a bunch of clowns

country of Australia has now become ground zero for expediting the New Normal agenda .\nAs the world spotlight now hones in on the draconian measures being enforced by the Australian government , ministerial departments are relying on numerous spokespersons in order to sell what are effectively unconstitutional policies and dictatorial \u2018 health regulations.\n\u2019 Currently running cover for the Prime Minister is Australia \u2019 s Health Minister Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive stance against civil liberties this week , which he believes is justified because the supposed \u2018 threat of the pandemic.\n\u2019 Hunt is championing an initiative previously launched by the country \u2019 s current Prime Minister Scot Morrison which was cynically named , \u201c No Jab , No Pay.\n\u201d Hunt explains how the government make its citizens take any vaccine they want to administer : \u201c We are keeping on the table the existing mechanisms we have such as no jab , no pay [ and ] no jab , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are one of the world \u2019 s great vaccination nations and I expect very widespread uptake.\n\u201d Another prominent public face is Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth , who has been tacked with promoting a number of Chinese-style medical surveillance initiatives including the country \u2019 s dubious \u201c COVIDSafe \u201d app , which the government claims has helped stop the spread of coronavirus .\nThis week , Coatsworth was sent in front of the cameras to sell what has become the world \u2019 s most totalitarian government vaccine policy \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits to vulnerable citizens , and even deny children access to education \u2013 unless they accept government \u201c encouragement \u201d to take whatever vaccines are being mandated at the time .\nDr. Coatsworth explains in the video clip below : These remarks come just days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison let slip in public \u2013 revealing his own preference for mandatory vaccinations of Australians , before quickly walking back his statement .\n\u201c There are no mechanisms for compulsory \u2026 I mean , we can \u2019 t hold someone down and make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday .\nIt \u2019 s now clear that the Australian government will attempt to use its divisive \u201c No Jab , No Pay \u201d scheme in order to force its most vulnerable and dependent members of the population to accept the newly fast-tracked , experimental COVID vaccine being touted by transnational pharmaceutical corporations like AstraZeneca and their financiers at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nGovernment and mainstream media are also drafting in other surrogates to help sell the new vaccine agenda , like Dr Zac Turner who recently went on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government should use its power to single out any \u201c anti-vaxxers \u201d and suspend their normal rights as citizens until they accept the government \u2019 s list of vaccines \u2013 in the name of \u2018 public health.\n\u2019 One thing is clear : this government seems determined to implement this transnational corporate agenda \u2013 regardless of the effects on its people .\nAustralians who reject coronavirus vaccination could lose access to some welfare payments , Health Minister Greg Hunt has said , after the Prime Minister conceded vaccination would not be mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine is not yet certain , the Government has taken steps to secure supply of a leading candidate developed at Oxford University .\nHealth Minister Greg Hunt said if a vaccine was discovered , the Government would consider applying measures like \u201c no jab , no pay \u201d to ensure a high uptake .\n\u201c It won \u2019 t be mandatory , but it will be widely encouraged , \u201d he said .\nThe government will aim for a 95 per cent vaccination rate , which it said would exclude those who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c We are keeping on the table the existing mechanisms we have such as no jab , no pay [ and ] no jab , no play , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We are one of the world \u2019 s great vaccination nations and I expect very widespread uptake.\n\u201d Mr Hunt said the existing no jab , no pay policy , which was introduced in 2015 , had helped lift child immunisation rates for other diseases .\nUnder the policy , to be eligible for the full Family Tax Benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , children need to be immunised .\nAsked whether vaccination status could be linked to welfare payments , school attendance or travel , Mr Hunt said the Government reserved the right to make such moves .\n\u201c I \u2019 m confident that a very , very large numbers of Australians will take it up , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We reserve the right , subject to medical advice , to take steps that might assist.\n\u201d Similarly , state governments in NSW , Victoria , Queensland , South Australia and West Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which require children to be fully vaccinated to be enrolled in childcare or kindergarten \u2014 unless they have a medical exemption .\nThe Federal Government yesterday announced that it had signed a letter of intent with drug company AstraZeneca , which is

Sins of Coronavirus", "content": "Society is awakening from its slumber .\nIn the UK , July the 4th marked a measure of independence .\nThe government deigned to allow pubs to swing open their saloon doors and let the population soak its worries in the traditional manner .\nIt seems to have been a breaking point for the otherwise impregnable dam of stymieing measures set-up by governments and institutions to hamper freedom in the name of risk-aversion .\nNow that the pubs are open , there is a feeling that the high-water mark has been reached and the flood waters are receding .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel safer to walk around on the streets , to see friends at close range and to enjoy the simple pleasures of life which for so long had been restricted .\nAlbeit that these \u2018 new \u2019 freedoms are imbibed with a prohibition-era feeling with sidelong looks at security guards and waiters who occasionally step in to enforce stringent rules dictated from above , lest they lose that precious license to operate and earn much needed incomes .\nThus , as the dust begins to settle , and the narrative shifts to \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to look back at the 3 or so months of martial law in the UK .\nFrom the inside it has been an isolating experience , we have been forced into virtual realities to feed our social appetite .\nIt is hard to gauge how the wider society is dealing with a massive normative shift .\nBehavioural changes have been wrought that have not been seen since total wars of the 20th century .\nNew industries have boomed , though it is prudent to investigate too those industries which have burned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change it helps to use a framework to interrogate the wide-reaching shifts in values and behaviours , to better understand what has been going on , and to rise above the tit-for-tat hubbub of the chattering mass of media .\nHere we take the old Catholic framework of the seven deadly , or mortal sins \u2013 as a tool to examine shifts in values .\nThey are built upon preceding integral character traits as defined by Plato and Aristotle , namely : Temperance , Wisdom , Justice and Courage .\nOriginally attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory , the \u2018 Seven Deadly Sins \u2019 gained popularity in the expanding Catholic Empire of the Middle Ages .\nWe \u2019 ll set aside the theological debates over using a Catholic judgement system for now , and simply treat it as a moral exercise to shed some light into the murky miasma of shifting values brought about by \u2018 the crisis \u2019 .\nIt is interesting to note how many of the actions of society line up with the sins .\nAnd before we cow our heads too low we will later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the promulgation of virtuous behaviour .\nWe commence with the sin of Greed .\nReadily witnessed in the early days of government imposed lockdown was the change in shopping behaviour .\nSupermarkets were cleared of dry goods and non-perishables .\nTraditionally this was the realm of the \u2018 prepper \u2019 \u2013 those marginal people who , so enraptured by their belief in a doomsday scenario spend most of their time in preparation , to ensure their survival .\nThe prepper mentality leaked into the mainstream as people hoarded whatever they could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the \u2018 next-day supply chain \u2019 model broke down when there was a huge shift in demand .\nCommercial producers still haven \u2019 t caught up with the demand for flour , the bottleneck being the packaging \u2013 not the supply itself .\nThere was some kickback to all this hoarding , with people demanding \u201c only take what you need \u201d and to leave enough for others .\nThis moral rule works fine in safe times , where people believe that there is enough to go around .\nHowever it breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it only takes one hoarder to trigger another , and the worst of human greed is pushed to the fore .\nWitness the man buying all of the sugar in the shop , or the lady with trolleys full of toilet roll \u2013 all of a sudden viewed as a precious and scarce commodity .\nMore deeply embroiled are those who seek to profit from this by selling those hoarded rolls at a huge markup on the black market .\nGreed was abundant in those early times and will not be readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is defined by over-indulgence .\nI paraphrase a maniacal megaphone user I witnessed speaking on the subject when he shouted \u201c Nothing soothes the death-anxiety like a sugary , fatty snack \u201d .\nIt is true , we humans being simple creatures derive great serotonin hits from the basest of pleasures such as consumption of sugar .\nThe other means of satisfaction having being denied to us , we turned to what little pleasures we could garner from the only avenues available ; the supermarket aisles .\nNever have the supermarkets been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long known the dangers of a diet of processed food , and had been told from early on that obesity increases the danger of viral infections to the body .\nEven still the weakened population fell upon the corporeal pleasures as something of a crutch .\nWho can blame them ?\nThe only mandated activity one was allowed was to visit the church of the Glutton .\nEven as the churches themselves were closed .\nAlthough as we move on Gluttony seems to be one of the lower sins when compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhere strictly to the stickers on the ground , if you asked too many questions of a shop assistant or if you venture out without a mask then you will surely have witnessed the sin of Wrath .\nIt is defined as \u2018 an intense emotional state involving a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived provocation , hurt or threat \u2019 .\nBy acting outside of the \u2018 rules \u2019 ( remember that in England at least , most restrictions are not \u2018 laws \u2019 but recommendations or rules ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few .\nThose who have quaffed deeply the kool-aid will be singing from the government hymn sheet .\nTheir moral code , underpinned by a new-found adoration of the NHS , is a moral high-ground above those who do not clap , for those who deign to see their friends in the real world , or the \u201c COVIDIOTS \u201d ( a hashtag trending on Twitter from the onset of lockdown ) who refuse to obey the individuating policies of anti-social distancing .\nCommitting any of these minor infractions brings a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage you to test this and see .\nStand in front of the yellow line and you will have the forces of hired security demanding that you step back .\nAdmitting to a neighbour that you went to a party will draw ire and in typical English fashion , a stoic silence .\nFail to wear a muzzle on the bus and you \u2019 ll have eyes burning at you , despite their being little hard evidence behind the benefit of wearing a mask .\nIt seems that following the science only gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholden by the devotees of the religion of coronavirus .\nThis article is written from an English perspective , even though the themes will ring true for many around the world to varying degrees .\nBut in England , more than anywhere , to quote the idiom \u201c A man \u2019 s home is his castle \u201d .\nIn times of yore it has been a place to recluse to , to enjoy a little peace and carry out one \u2019 s private life .\nIn the new regime , it has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensconced .\nJust like any prisoner in a cell , with little stimulation and a hoard of food , one turns to the next sin ; that of Sloth .\nSloth is a form of laziness or disinclination to exertion .\nIt is a very easy habit to fall into , we have such good entertainment technologies in computers and with online shopping a world of toys can be on your doorstep the next day .\nBut , to quote another idiom : \u201c Habits begin as cobwebs and end as chains \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dwellings \u2013 held by a concoction of fear of the outside and comfort of the inside .\nDespite the beautiful English Summer that blossomed before us , all roads lead to home .\nSloth is an insidious sin , being very easy to slip into and hard to pull out from .\nIt will be one of the legacies of the lockdown policy that many will lead more sedentary lifestyles , having become accustomed to them .\nThis will have a concomitant effect on health and the economy , with fewer people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , to make the world a little better and to multiply that all important productivity .\nThese months spent at home will have lead many to inspect their immediate surroundings , and find them lacking .\nFinding ones habitude to be wanting leads to the next sin , that of Envy .\nWho has not been envious in these times of those with a large garden , with some outdoor shade and perhaps a private swimming pool ?\nThe divide between those who dwell in pokey tenements and those in expansive manors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , who spend many of their waking hours out of the home , have been forced onto the kitchen table \u2013 with no recompense from the company for this office space .\nIt is no surprise perhaps then , that many people have re-evaluated their living situation and gazed with invisious eyes to those who can live a more free private life in a walled garden , or more brightly gilded cage .\nEnvy is a corrosive substance with jealousy eating away at the self-confidence of even the strongest spirit .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : have we baked as much bread as our friends on social media ?\nHave we perfected that exercise routine and shed pounds ?\nWhy are we debt-trapped in a less than perfect living situation ?\nComparing one \u2019 s self with others can be helpful , but without a solid grounding it can be destructive to our autonomy .\nLust is probably one of the better known sins , and is promoted in Western culture through Hollywood , advertising and cultural norms .\nOne can lust for money , for sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrives in the absence of satisfaction so has found fertile fields in the enforced abstinence of recent months .\nVisits to pornography websites have surged .\nMany people have been partaking in secretive relationships driven by lust and fear \u2013 both more base instincts of humanity .\nLust can be seen to have had a role in the hoarding of food , but I would argue it is more readily visible in the governments activity .\nThe lust for power is well documented by those who study the political sphere .\nWe have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-room coup ; our Prime Minister was taken into hospital , having his phone taken away .\nIt thus fell to groups of advisers and technocrats , ruling through the SAGE group among others , to decide policy and dictate the response to the perceived threat of a novel virus threat .\nThey wasted no time in instituting wide-ranging surveillance powers through \u2018 track-and-trace \u2019 , with proposals to take it further through policies such as a vaccination passport , commonly referred to as \u2018 Immunity Passports.\n\u2019 They were helped along their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritarians , who marauded around parks , breaking up small family picnics , issuing fines to innocent walkers who rested too long on their favourite bench to name only a few of their activates .\nTheir job as a municipal official combined with ambiguous rule-making by unelected technocrats gave the perfect framework for the lust for power to flourish .\nFurthermore , this wave of power wielding does not show signs of abating , even as the public slowly awaken from their slumber .\nThey awaken to the \u2018 New Normal \u2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for the purposes of control .\nIt does its work in the background , only poking the tip of the iceberg above the surface to \u2018 nudge \u2019 policy hither or thither .\nOne very visible manner in which new norms are promulgated is government propaganda .\nThat being slogans , repeated phrases and assumed values which are used in every speech , emblazoned on lecterns at the bully pulpit and even used in mass advertising campaigns \u2013 which advertently helped keep the floundering legacy media alive , or at least on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced memes being the unabashed worship of the NHS , bringing us to the final of our sins : that of Pride .\nPride is rooted in the characteristics of hubris and overconfidence .\nIt is an unjustified belief in oneself or of an identity .\nWe have had it poured on us from early doors by the government , telling us how great the NHS is for patching us up , how the Great British spirit will carry us through this crisis and how each of us can be a \u2018 local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofas .\nThey do say though , that pride comes before a fall , and that too much hubris can lead us astray .\nCould it be that our national pride , freely whipped up as a means of control , could harm us in this instance ?\nPride can blind us from seeing problems .\nWe could be too proud to admit that lockdown policies might have caused more harm than good , as is the case in nursing homes the world over .\nWe could be too proud to admit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or too proud to remedy that .\nHubris among the ancient Greeks was seen to have some level of humiliation involved .\nThe government suddenly defining many peoples \u2019 whole livelihoods as \u2018 non-essential \u2019 is an ultimate act of hubris , or humiliation .\nAnd we are left with its by-product of shame .\nIt is a shame which is hard to shake off as even today many activities of self-fulfilment are limited and the regular activity of society is hardly being resumed .\nThese sins and vices do paint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , they do not exist in solitude ; they are meant to help illustrate virtue .\nIt is easy to do down people and their activity , to pick out egregious behaviours among others when times are hard .\nBut I quote here from Sir Julian Rose ( speaking on Sunday Wire EP # 322 ) to demonstrate that all is not yet lost : Hard times create strong people , it has long been known .\nBut for those of us who have lived without the spectre of war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technologically-mediated service society have not really witnessed \u2018 hard times \u2019 .\nPerhaps now is that time , where virtues can be hewn from the hard foundations of the social contract .\nWe will examine the Seven Virtues of the Catholic school and how they may positively be applied to society under a perceived coronavirus threat .\nLet us begin with Kindness , or in the Church \u2019 s favoured latin : Humanitas .\nSaid to be one characteristic that sets us apart from the animal state of being : kindness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just as much as there has been selfishness and greed there has been selfless giving .\nFood banks in the UK have seen a much greater level of donations during the perceived crisis .\nThis is mirrored with charity donations and volunteer work in the community .\nWhere once we had the state leading the way in caring for the less fortunate through subsidy and service we now have non-state groups such as mutual aid co-operatives springing up in communities throughout the villages and towns of the UK .\nThese pose us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer an optimistic view for how we humans can care for one another without relying on authority based institutions .\nThey have more than filled in the gap between needs and supply and will continue to grow , I \u2019 m sure .\nSpeaking of growing , if you have visited the garden center you can \u2019 t help but have noticed the sacking of all fruit and vegetable seeds and plants .\nPeople have been craving that long-lost contact with Mother Nature and these times have lead many to re-establish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with some level of Diligence , the correspondent virtue to the sin of Sloth .\nGrowing your own food is harder than buying it , and we will not become self-sufficient from a few tomato plants .\nIt does however induce an ethic of hard work and persistence , of attentive compassion and fosters a sense of achievement when the crop is harvested which is much more than the satisfaction of merely buying the fruit .\nIt is telling that the government originally defined the buying of seeds as \u2018 non-essential \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own became a little English rebellion against them .\nAs much as there is greed among those hoarders in supermarkets , there is Temperance : the virtue of abstinence .\nIt is one which is easier to manifest when ones freedom is restricted , we can simply do without .\nWe then rediscover the little things in life , the beauty of the countryside , the simplicity of a book , all of which benefit us over the 21st Century opiates offered through the internet .\nIt is my belief that a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that many people will have broken off bad habits like smoking , and taken up good habits such as walking .\nThis is no mean feat when , before this crisis , it was hard to induce people to take such small steps towards their own self benefit .\nI for one have been abstaining from supermarkets , in part because of their reaction and puissant freedom restrictions in-store , but in part because it is more in line with my values .\nThe period of enforced shut-down enabled a re-calibration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass is in fact much greener on the other side , one can get fresh produce at open markets and not get suckered into deals on sugary , hollow-caloried products offered by supermarkets , in this manner one can abstain and yet seem to have gained .\nThis leads to a sense of Purity , the virtue which is sullied by Lust .\nI shan \u2019 t delve into the personal lives and loves of individuals , but suffice to say that it is probably a good thing for people to have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture .\nSometimes we need a little time with just ourselves to find out more who we are , and what we need .\nThis leads into what Sir Rose was saying about going deeper into ourselves .\nIt is precious , this time of relative peace where we can do some soul-searching and it catalyses a strengthening of character , which will be invaluable as he notes , in times to come .\nHumility is difficult in this day and age .\nIt is hard for us to cede to others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny the authority of some institutions through this period .\nHowever , humility includes in its ranks bravery , and I have witnessed this in no ending supply .\nBe it the bravery of those who report information that counters the populist government narrative , and face consequential censorship and slander for doing so .\nOr those who bravely go out and do their day job , despite mutterings of dissent .\nCourage is taking action even with a present threat , so for anyone who had the courage to act beneficently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , you are to be applauded .\nIt is important to be humble and modest , particularly when driven to some degree of stir-crazy by governmental policy .\nContrary to the Wrath of the tutting person in the queue , the stare of the mirthful mask-wearer or the over-zealous police officer stands Patience .\nPatience is a virtue , as we are taught as children , but it seems to stop being lauded there .\nIt is a virtue worthy in all times , not just in crisis , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With quick delivery of online services and goods , with instantaneous entertainment of all forms and bodily pleasures widely promoted , it takes a wiser person to pursue patience these days .\nWith time to ones \u2019 -self we can pursue that patience .\nI will not evangelise meditation or yoga , even though they are

policies , driving the country and ts people even closer to full-blown medical martial law .\nThis week , Australian PM Scott Morrison was caught on record saying that COVID vaccines should be mandatory for all citizens , but was forced to backtrack on his statements after public outrage over his authoritarian statements .\nOne Sydney doctor is now openly advocating that the government

transport without a face mask .\nAnd when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could refuse these anti-vaxxers from visiting their retail outlets , gyms , movie cinemas , restaurants , bars or nightclubs , \u201d says Dr Zac Turner .\n\u201c As a precedence , state governments have previously banned children from attending childcare if they are not vaccinated .\nSimilar restrictions could be placed on Australians who refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccination , \u201d he adds .\nPerhaps not surprisingly , Turner is also former employee of vaccine firm AstraZeneca \u2013 the same company which has sewn-up a deal with the Australian government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone questioning the safety or efficacy of vaccines as \u201c clowns \u201d and believes they pose a direct threat danger to rest of the right-thinking citizens who will comply with government orders .\nDr Zac Turner is writing for News.com.au and says\u2026 With news of vaccines reaching their final stages and our government signing a deal to buy 25 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca , many of us are thinking with relief that it is all over .\nUnfortunately , it is not even close to halfway .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradicate the transmission of COVID-19 , Australia would need about 80 to 95 per cent of its population vaccinated , which in reality may take up until late next year .\nAnd a key element to achieving this is to convince everyone to get vaccinated \u2013 even those people who are the curse of the scientific community , anti-vaxxers .\nThat means 20 million Australians is the vaccination target .\nSince January , Australia has conducted 5,380,613 COVID-19 tests .\nTo achieve our target , we would need to double that number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .\nIt will be a landmark test of our country , and it will be a chapter in our history textbooks .\nOnce a vaccine is approved for general use , it will take a minimum of three to six months for it to be made available to the entire population of Australia .\nDuring this time , it could be difficult for authorities to determine who is an anti-vaxxer versus somebody who is yet to be offered the vaccine .\nThe government should consider updating the current \u201c yellow fever vaccination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinations before visiting high risk countries .\nThese could easily be turned into electronic vaccine cards and offered to each Australian .\nAt least 2 to 5 per cent of the Australian population can not be vaccinated due to health reasons , especially those with serious allergies .\nIt \u2019 s important to protect those who can \u2019 t be vaccinated by having everyone around them vaccinated \u2013 so it can not spread .\nThe next biggest threat to the virus is those who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19 .\nIn America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans would not get the vaccine even if it was readily available and affordable .\nThat \u2019 s startling enough to hear but we should recognise as a cultural extension of America , our population could not be too far off this as well .\nAustralia \u2019 s next obstacle will be getting people to be vaccinated .\nWe can not afford to be complacent .\nThe problem is a bunch of clowns

\u2019 s also been revealed how Gates is funding the supposed \u2018 fact checkers \u2019 currently being used by Facebook and other social media firms \u2013 which are aggressively censoring any

maintain \u2018 editorial independence from philanthropic funders.\n\u2019 Indeed , Gates has certainly covered all his bases .\nThe following investigative findings by one of America \u2019 s leading journalism review bodies should give cause for concern to news consumers all over the world .\nLast August NPR profiled a Harvard-led experiment to help low-income families find housing in wealthier neighborhoods , giving their children access to better schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poverty.\n\u201d According to researchers cited in the article , these children could see $ 183,000 greater earnings over their lifetimes\u2014a striking forecast for a housing program still in its experimental stage .\nIf you squint as you read the story , you \u2019 ll notice that every quoted expert is connected

@ @ @ @ from Gates .\nNPR \u2019 s funding from Gates \u201c was not a factor in why or how we did the story , \u201d reporter Pam Fessler says , adding that her reporting went beyond the voices quoted in her article .\nThe story , nevertheless , is one of hundreds NPR has reported about the Gates Foundation or the work it funds , including myriad favorable pieces written from the perspective of Gates or its grantees .\nAnd that speaks to a larger trend\u2014and ethical issue\u2014with billionaire philanthropists \u2019 bankrolling the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda includes promoting charter schools , at one point funded part of the LA Times \u2019 reporting on education .\nCharles Koch has made charitable donations to journalistic institutions such as the Poynter Institute , as well as

\u201c through the lens of effective altruism \u201d \u2014often looking at philanthropy .\nAs philanthropists increasingly fill in the funding gaps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand in the media downturn following the coronavirus pandemic\u2014an underexamined worry is how this will affect the ways newsrooms report on their benefactors .\nNowhere does this concern loom larger than with the Gates Foundation , a leading donor to newsrooms and a frequent subject of favorable news coverage .\nI recently examined nearly twenty thousand charitable grants the Gates Foundation had made through the end of June and found more than $ 250 million going toward journalism .\nRecipients included news operations like the BBC , NBC , Al Jazeera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Univision , Medium , the Financial Times , The Atlantic , the Texas Tribune , Gannett , Washington Monthly , Le Monde , and the Center for Investigative Reporting ; charitable organizations affiliated with news outlets , like BBC Media Action and the New York Times \u2019 Neediest Cases Fund ; media companies such as Participant , whose documentary Waiting for \u201c Superman \u201d supports Gates \u2019 s agenda on charter schools ; journalistic organizations such as the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting , the National Press Foundation , and the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other groups creating news content or working on journalism , such as the Leo Burnett Company , an ad agency that Gates commissioned to create a \u201c news site \u201d to promote the success of aid groups .\nIn some cases , recipients say they distributed part of the funding as subgrants to other journalistic organizations\u2014which makes it difficult to see the full picture of Gates \u2019 s funding into the fourth estate .\nThe foundation even helped fund a 2016 report from the American Press Institute that was used to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence from philanthropic funders .\nA top-level finding : \u201c There is little evidence that funders insist on or have any editorial review.\n\u201d Notably , the study \u2019 s underlying survey data showed that nearly a third of funders reported having seen at least some content they funded before publication .\nGates \u2019 s generosity appears to have helped foster an increasingly friendly media environment for the world \u2019 s most visible charity .\nTwenty years ago , journalists scrutinized Bill Gates \u2019 s initial foray into philanthropy as a vehicle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PR exercise to salvage his battered reputation following Microsoft \u2019 s bruising antitrust battle with the Department of Justice .\nToday , the foundation is most often the subject of soft profiles and glowing editorials describing its good works .\nDuring the pandemic , news outlets have widely looked to Bill Gates as a public health expert on covid\u2014even though Gates has no medical training and is not a public official .\nPolitiFact and USA Today ( run by the Poynter Institute and Gannett , respectively\u2014both of which have received funds from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact-checking platforms to defend Gates from \u201c false conspiracy theories \u201d and \u201c misinformation , \u201d like the idea that the foundation has financial investments in companies developing covid vaccines and therapies .\nIn fact , the foundation \u2019 s website and most recent tax forms clearly show investments in such companies , including Gilead and CureVax .\nIn the same way that the news media has given Gates an outsize voice in the pandemic , the foundation has long used its charitable giving to shape the public discourse on everything from global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence that has landed Bill Gates on Forbes \u2019 s list of the most powerful people in the world .\nThe Gates Foundation can point to important charitable accomplishments over the past two decades\u2014like helping drive down polio and putting new funds into fighting malaria\u2014but even these efforts have drawn expert detractors who say that Gates may actually be introducing harm , or distracting us from more important , lifesaving public health projects .\nFrom virtually any of Gates \u2019 s good deeds , reporters can also find problems with the foundation \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look .\nBut readers don \u2019 t hear these critical voices in the news as often or as loudly as Bill and Melinda \u2019 s .\nNews about Gates these days is often filtered through the perspectives of the many academics , nonprofits , and think tanks that Gates funds .\nSometimes it is delivered to readers by newsrooms with financial ties to the foundation .\nThe Gates Foundation declined multiple interview requests for this story and would not provide its own accounting of how much

draconian lockdowns ever seen .\nAs a result , the country \u2019 s economy has crashed even further , forcing hundreds of thousands on welfare .\nIt soon became clear that Australia was going to be the ground zero test bed for the globalists \u2019 \u2018 New Normal \u2019 agenda .\nBecause of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria and New South Wales , the country \u2019 s leadership decided to impose one of the worst lockdowns in the world .\nFor its law abiding citizens , the prospects of a quarantine-free travel and freedom of movement has become a thing of the past .\nHow long the current impasse will last is anyone \u2019 s guess .\nFor millions of Australians , a dark reality is now beginning to set in : if you own a passport , you probably won \u2019 t be able to use it anytime this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year too .\nLast week we learned that Prime Minister Scott Morrison told his subjects that it is \u201c unlikely \u201d that Australia \u2019 s borders will be closed until Christmas 2020 , and more likely beyond that into spring of 2021 .\n\u201c I would welcome if by Christmas it were possible , but I think it \u2019 s unlikely that we [ will be ] able to move back to a restriction-free society [ by then ] , \u201d said the PM .\n\u201c I doubt that is going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will enable it.\n\u201d The announcement means that the countries electorate are effectively prisoners of the state \u2013 a situation not unlike the heavy hand of state control experienced in the Soviet Union , where party commisars forbid its citizens from freely travelling in and out of the country , with heavily surveilled and restricted movement between states , along with state restrictions on freedom of assembly in public \u2013 all of which are now set features under the current regime in Australia .\nThe Financial Times describes the situation as followers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminally ill , her first thought was to fly back to the UK .\nBut as a permanent Australian resident she was banned from leaving the country owing to coronavirus travel restrictions and her request for an exemption on compassionate grounds was turned down .\n\u201c My grandmother has been such an

appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banning its residents and citizens from leaving the country , the government also made the unprecedented move to shut its borders to non-residents , imposing caps of 4,000 passengers per week for expats \u2018 permitted \u2019 to return home .\nIn a recent piece by writer Caitlin Fitzsimmons , the situation was described as \u2018 On par with North Korea \u2019 , with many MPs now forced to deal an increasing numbers of requests to help people stranded in Australia because of the international travel ban , and also citizens hamstrung overseas .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Korea , in terms of , are we now a prison state , that unless you can justify yourself to the department , you can not leave the country ?\n\u201d said MP Zali Steggall .\n\u201c Even in times of war

its seemingly strict quarantine policies , recent data sets show that thousands of foreign visitors have been pouring into the country each month .\nIn the near term , its only visible lifeline to the outside world may be with its antipodean neighbor New Zealand , whose government is currently being run by a Tony Blair disciple and committed globalist , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern , who recent moved to shut the country down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases \u2019 were detected , triggering more mass hysteria of a \u2018 second wave \u2019 surge of coronavirus there .\nMore worrying though is PM Morrison and his officials recent comments implying that Australians will be subject mandatory vaccinations as soon as the new fast-tracked experimental COVID vaccine is finally made available .\nSuch a policy would likely give way to a new system of digital \u201c immunity passports , \u201d with Australia already far down the road in developing comprehensive digital identity systems .\nWhen you combine this extreme policy initiative with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s borders , it soon becomes clear that the government in Canberra is willing to go all the way in suspending basic freedoms like travel and free movement \u2013 in order to make the population submit to its demands of medical martial law .\nAustralian libertarian Gideon Rozner raises the alarm regarding Prime Minister Scott Morrison \u2019 s

measures supposedly laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so few people in their country in comparison to other nations around the world which haven \u2019 t enacted such harsh authoritarian measures .\nAll of this has left millions of resident confused about where they stand going forward .\nWant to leave Australia ?\nYou better have a good reason .\nA son or daughter getting married overseas won \u2019 t do

of applications turned down .\nAnd those people , you would expect , had at least some sort of reason to depart the country other than pure pleasure .\nContrast that with Europe right now , where

Erdo\u011fan wants some kind of election guarantee from the citizens as he says the gas extraction will start in 2023 .\nIt looks as if the President wants to give an impression that any other

energy within Turkey \u2019 s borders .\nYetkin insightfully remarks that before \u201c the 2007 elections , it was announced that natural gas was found in Thrace and Salt Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2010

that \u201c [ t ] his map can become real .\nThis map is congruent with today \u2019 s scientific research .\nThat is the interesting [ part ] .\n\u201d In reality though Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid \u2019 s \u2018 Oil Map \u2019 proved to be yet another pipe dream .\nAs related by Yetkin , before \u201c the 2014 elections , the good news [ was ] the finding of shale gas in Diyarbak\u0131r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s demand for 40 years .\nAhead of the June 7 , 2015 election , it was announced that natural gas was found in Thrace , and before the Nov. 1 , 2015 election , natural gas was discovered in the Black Sea .\nBefore the 2018 elections , new oil fields were found in Mardin , \u015e\u0131rnak , Hakkari , Batman and Siirt and natural gas in Thrace.\n\u201d But now , the Prez himself is adamant that the drillship Fatih has discovered rich gas holdings ( \u201c some 320 billion cubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within Turkey \u2019 s territorial waters .\nBut the online news website Ahval puts forward that many \u2018 analysts and officials have said Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s recent foreign and domestic ventures \u2013 including converting the Hagia Sopha landmark into a mosque and risking a direct confrontation with neighbouring Greece over territorial disputes \u2013 are designed to divert the Turkish public \u2019 s attention away from Turkey \u2019 s cratering economy.\n\u2019 For , one should not lose track of the fact that though the drillship Fatih discovered gas under the Black Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mediterranean , while claiming a special territorial relationship with Libya across the water on the African continent .\nAs the Greek journalist John Psaropoulos , whom I am happy to call my friend , points out : \u201c Twice in three weeks this summer , Greece and Turkey poised to clash in the Eastern Mediterranean .\n.\n.\nGreek and Turkish navies fanned out across the Aegean and east Mediterranean .\nThe two NATO allies have come closer to open conflict than they have since 1996 , when Turkey planted a flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aegean , and since 1987 , when Turkey again sent a survey ship into the north Aegean.\n\u201d But in spite of this recent and loud sabre-rattling , Psaropoulos correctly point out that \u201c Turkey seeks to corner Greece into a maritime territorial settlement.\n\u201d For , the Prez is really looking for a deal , a deal would skirt \u201c past established international legal norms , [ a deal that would ] force Greece , and later Cyprus , to declare their vast continental shelves joint development zones with Turkey.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prez to replicate his Black Sea \u2018 good tidings.\n\u2019 As Fatih \u2019 s find does not really appear to be that significant at the end of the day , as underlined by the Turkish economist U\u011fur G\u00fcrses : Turkey \u2019 s domestic \u201c consumption of roughly 45 billion square cubes [ of natural gas ] a year roughly translates to seven years of production.\n\u201d And that means , that the drillship Fatih might just be able to carry the Prez and his AKP henchmen into the uncharted territories beyond the centenary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second century of Turkey \u2019 s existence promises to be an era quite unlike any in the Republic \u2019 s history , an era that would undoubtedly flourish with Mediterranean gas to fund and uphold Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s pseudo-Ottoman dreams of the New Turkey as an Islamic state in its own right .\nOther than Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s m\u00fcjde on 21 August , another event also occupied the headlines and shocked people all around the world : The Kariye Museum , which had previously been known as the Church of the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mosque .\nFollowing last month \u2019 s re-conversion of the Ayasofya , this 11th-century Orthodox church that had been a mosque following the conquest of Istanbul but was used as a museum since 1945 \u2013 the building namely houses most exquisite examples of Byzantine frescoes and mosaics \u2013 was also turned into a mosque again .\nStill , this event should not have come as a surprise : a \u201c Turkish court [ already ] in November [ 2019 ] annulled Chora \u2019 s museum status and [ now ] on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erdogan declared \u2018 the management of the Kariye Mosque be transferred to the Religious Affairs Directorate [ or Diyanet ] , and opened to worship.\n\u2019 The pro-government Daily Sabah newspaper reported that Turkey \u2019 s religious authorities plan to cover the renowned Byzantine-era frescoes and mosaics during prayers.\n\u201d In this way , in the space of but a month , the Prez turned two important samples of Istanbul \u2019 s pre-Ottoman cultural heritage into Muslim places of worship .\nAt the same time , another well-known relic of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack now : namely , the Galata tower , built by the Genoese in 1348 as part of the city wall surrounding its trade colony in the Eastern Roman capital of Constantinople .\nFollowing the conquest of the city , Sultan Mehmed II ( 1451-81 ) , popularly known as \u201c Fatih \u201d or \u201c The Conqueror in Turkey , \u201d ordered the demolition of the wall , but allowed the tower to remain .\nIn the following centuries , the Galata Tower became part and parcel of the Ottoman city and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tower which had been part of the remit of the Istanbul Municipality for the past 164 years , became subject to the AKP Ministry of Culture and Tourism by means of a sudden legal decree .\nAnd subsequently , the Ministry set to work straightaway , initiating its renovation , \u201c one jackhammer blow at a time.\n\u201d Whether this is but the outcome of the common misapprehension present in Turkey when it comes to renovation and restoration , or the result of Ankara \u2019 s attempt to rid the erstwhile Ottoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open question .\nAt the same time , employing the ongoing coronavirus hysteria as an excuse , the Ankara government has cancelled this year \u2019 s Victory Day celebrations ( Zafer Bayram\u0131 ) , commemorating Mustafa Kemal \u2019 s victory over the Greek military at Dumlup\u0131nar in 1922 .\nThis victory ended the War of Independence ( 1919-22 ) and directly led to the signature of the Treary of Lausanne ( 24 July 1923 ) and the subsequent foundation of the Republic of Turkey ( 29 October 1923 ) .\nAre these portents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henchmen are really getting ready to bring back Islamic rule to Turkey on the 100th anniversary of the Turkish state \u2019 s foundation .\n.\n.\nWill the culmination of the AKP policy of Sunnification be the foundation of a pseudo-Ottoman Federation of Islamic Peoples of Anatolia , arguably still called Turkey yet ruled by Sharia law ?\nWill this also lead to a revived Caliphate and a united Islamic world following Turkey \u2019 s lead ?\nWe will arguably find out in about three years \u2019 time .\n.\n.\n*** 21WIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent historian and geo-political analyst who

prediction fared .\nOn his prediction \u201c The prediction has fared less well than I hoped\u2026There are 55,000 deaths in the USA every week approximately and right now it \u2019 s about 5,000 over that .\nSo I think the details of that prediction have fared less well than I hope but it served as a milestone and what we mean by \u2018 over \u2019 .\nIt highlighted the importance of looking at excess deaths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction .\nMy mistake was that I should have done a range instead of a number.\n\u201d On his earlier Israel prediction [ case study ] \u201c The problem was that I should have said excess deaths .\nThere was a time when Israel had no deaths and the number of cases were about 150 , but I was certainly wrong about that\u2026 When i researched it , I found a really big surprise : when you compare 2020 to 2019 , there are actually a few hundred fewer excess deaths in 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said excess deaths weren \u2019 t 10 but minus 100 !\nIf you did the exact same comparison not to 2019 but to 2018 or 2017 , you find that there was quite significant excess deaths in Israel by about 1000 in the rough period of coronavirus .\nIf you try to track it against the deaths , it doesn \u2019 t track \u2014 it \u2019 s a much broader peak .\nPerhaps something else happened then \u201d On testing \u201c At some point we are going to get tired of testing

coronaviruses by their nature are staid and have a relatively large genome , which is three times larger than the flu .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s genome is seven little pieces so it can swap pieces with other flus .\nIt causes massive excess deaths year after year .\nI don \u2019 t think coronavirus where will be a winter wave of any substance .\nOn returning to normality \u201c Lack of normality is a terrible risk .\nWe \u2019 ve torn the fabric of society and I would not be surprised if the risk of tearing society apart constitutes a 10 times higher excess death risk .\nPeople die from poverty , desperation and alcoholism .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption over the past month and we could easily see excess deaths .\nA strong smoker loses 10 years of life , which is 120 times higher risk .\nAn alcoholic might lose four to five years of life from this compared to coronavirus.\n\u201d On lockdown \u201c It was probably wrong of me to say that lockdown was a mistake .\nIf people have done it , they should be told that it was probably a good idea when they did it , but it \u2019 s no longer necessary and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of .\nThe damage caused by lockdown is something we will suffer but there \u2019 s no point in dwelling on it .\nGoing forward we need to basically do whatever we can to get back to normal like schools starting or museums opening .\n\u201c Panic shortens your life \u201d Back in March my main aim was to stop the panic .\nPanic is dangerous and it shortens your life probably more than by a month so we need to think about that .\nWhat \u2019 s important is the values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier blog post : what can we do to stop this voluntary suicide of western civilisation .\nThis is the choice that \u2019 s facing us : with

the former East Germany .\nAt best , it will breed distrust of and contempt for the law .\nAt worst , it will fracture the very fabric of society \u201d \u2013 Ross Clark On Monday , British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new \u2018 pre-lockdown \u2019 measures , under the cryptic sounding heading of , The Rule of Six , which came into force despite protests from leading civil liberties advocates and legal scholars \u2013 warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families unfairly apart , as well as destroy the Christmas season .\nJohnson also announced that he would be recruiting thousands of new \u2018 COVID Marshals \u2018 to help the state enforce all of the meticulous new rules and laws laid down this week .\nThe first Marshals in England were seen on Monday , enforcing social distancing and one-way system on pavements , and telling people to wear masks in shops and takeaways venues .\nThey will also be handing out masks and hand sanitizer in order to \u201c keep everyone safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt Hancock effectively threatened the collective punishment of a second lockdown should the population not follow the government \u2019 s rules , stating that \u201c \u2026 if people follow the social distancing rules , then we can stop that from happening here.\n\u201d The governments new push if based on the claim that \u2018 cases are on the rise , \u2019 even though hospitalisations and deaths attributed to COVID have plummeted to near zero .\nThe same data is reflected in almost every other country globally , but the UK government are pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who happens to test positive for the presence of any genetic material in their system via a PCR test for coronavirus is somehow a \u201c case \u201d \u2013 even though the PCR test is not a diagnostic test .\nThe scale of the UK government \u2019 s own administrative fraud became visible last month when it was revealed how numbers were inflated by exaggerated hospital coronavirus admissions during peak of pandemic \u2013 where health officials were recklessly counting patients who were actually sick for other reasons \u2013 meaning that people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government \u2019 s data sets .\nThe Government \u2019 s Science Advisory Group for Emergencies ( SAGE ) found patients were categorised as Covid-19 hospital admissions if they had ever tested positive for the disease .\nFormer UK Supreme Court justice , Lord Sumption , rebuked the government by denouncing the legislation as \u201c pointless , arbitrary and unnecessary , \u201d and further warned that the new law will be \u201c unenforceable \u201d and would only work if the country adopted a \u201c Stasi-style \u201d network of \u201c snoopers and informers.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further snowballed this week after UK Home Secretary Priti Patel told a SKY News program that she would call the police if she saw her neighbours having a party which she though was breaking the state \u2019 s latest raft of COVID laws .\nAs the Tory Cabinet \u2019 s Home Secretary , Patel is the country \u2019 s top law enforcement official , told Breakfast Show host Kay Burley that , \u201c I \u2019 m rarely at home but if I saw something that I thought was inappropriate then , quite frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government are threatening citizens with punitive fines of up to \u00a33,200 if they do not obey the state \u2019 s new Coronavirus decrees .\nNormally , the opposition party would seize upon an untoward comment like Patel \u2019 s and use it the batter the ruling government in an attempt to create contrast for the electorate .\nBut this is not happening , as both parties appear to be fully committed the official \u2018 pandemic \u2019 narrative .\nNew Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is also in lockstep with the Tory \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former Labour leader Ed Miliband also echoed Patel \u2019 s call for a snitch culture , saying , \u201c I think we should call the authorities , yes .\nAll of us have a responsibility to act [ reporting neighbours to the police ] .\n\u201d As a result of the comments by both Patel and Miliband , the terms \u201c East Germany \u201d and \u201c Stasi \u201d are now two of the top trending words for the UK on Twitter this week .\nThe brief conversation seems harmless enough .\nSetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your three children , you bump into Mr and Mrs Smith and their daughter from down the road .\nNaturally you stop for a chat .\nIt all seems so innocent \u2014 the sort of social interaction that makes for a happy and healthy community .\nA few hours later , though , you receive a call from the local police station .\nYou are told that a well-meaning neighbour spotted your seemingly harmless exchange and has reported you for breaking the new so-called \u2018 rule of six \u2019 restrictions on socialising .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you off this time but he \u2019 s recorded the \u2018 incident \u2019 and if it happens again \u2014 and you dare to congregate in groups larger than six \u2014 you could be fined \u00a3100 .\nSuch a scenario could be taken straight from a dystopian nightmare similar to that portrayed in George Orwell \u2019 s 1984 .\nBut it could also soon become a terrifying reality .\nFor , astonishingly , shopping our neighbours for breaking the latest draconian Covid rules is exactly what policing minister Kit Malthouse has encouraged us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 \u2019 s Today programme yesterday , he even suggested that the Government might set up a dedicated helpline for would-be curtain twitchers .\nAnd the grim truth is that , if implemented , I suspect it could be more popular than John Major \u2019 s infamous \u2018 cones hotline \u2019 , used by the public in the early 1990s to moan about roadworks .\nFor while we were told when this pandemic first hit that coronavirus would bring out the best in society , I am sad to say that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 within weeks there was a growing culture of fear and paranoia as it became evident that many among us were unafraid of informing on neighbours who broke the guidelines .\nCertainly it is quite right that we report serious abuses of the lockdown rules , such as impromptu raves attended by hundreds of people .\nBut what has happened since the Covid restrictions were introduced in March has extended far beyond that .\nWithin a month , according to the National Police Chiefs \u2019 Council , members of the public had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chief constable of Northamptonshire police said that his force had received \u2018 dozens and dozens \u2019 of calls from people tipping them off about neighbours who had dared to leave their houses for their second run of the day .\nThe same police force even said it was contacted by someone reporting a passer-by for coughing without using a handkerchief .\nOf course , lockdown has also revealed the authoritarian tendencies within Britain \u2019 s police forces .\nIn particular , police in Derbyshire were rightly admonished by civil liberties campaigners for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking in the Peak District \u2014 which wasn \u2019 t actually illegal .\nIn a separate incident , a South Yorkshire police

unprecedented .\nNone of this is theoretical any more \u2013 it \u2019 s what has already been deployed , albeit to varying degrees and in certain regions , in countries like China , South Korea and Singapore .\nWhen the COVID crisis first hit , it came as no surprise to see Singapore impose one of the strictest lockdowns and travel restrictions on the planet , and enforced the use of masks .\nBut universal adoption has been hampered in part by generational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in Singapore has launched a new device designed to close that gap .\nIn its bid to supposedly \u2018 help curb the spread \u2019 of COVID , the government launched its new wearable COVID tracking tag , which is being called a \u201c token.\n\u201d Under its friendly-sounding brand , TraceTogether , the device uses Bluetooth technology to ping other people nearby using the app \u2013 giving the government a running database for tracking potential coronavirus \u2018 cases.\n\u2019 NOTE : Readers should be aware that of all the large global corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing the most amount of \u2018 pandemic \u2019 propaganda \u2013 on a near hourly basis .\nFollow their Twitter feed to monitor their aggressive promotion of all things COVID ; masks , lockdowns and \u2018 New Normal \u2019 policies .\nThe new personal track and trace tag is supposed to be \u2018 voluntary \u2019 but it portends the shape of things to come ; by complementing the government \u2019 s existing mobile phone app which has achieved nearly 75 % adoption among the population , the new Bluetooth tag will help the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 % of the population .\nThe initial models are fairly plain , but the government plans to launch a trendier version with new colours to try and make this surveillance device more fashionable .\nSince day one , COVID policies in Singapore were among the most obsessive in the world , with state officials seemingly believing they could achieve near \u201c Zero COVID \u201d by constantly tweaking their lockdown strategies , and re-calibrating \u201c exit strategies.\n\u201d Six months on , there seems to be no sign of pulling back , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken on the characteristics of a new state religion in Singapore .\nIn this age of global media , authoritarian governments and technocrats are getting hip to the need to portray new authoritarian applications as having a \u2018 democratic \u2019 feel , and something which is only for the collective good , hence the program \u2019 s name , \u201c Trace Together.\n\u201d Any concerns about data protection are usually allayed with platitudes from authorities claiming that the new surveillance technology is there to \u2018 help vulnerable groups to feel safer.\n\u2019 Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact-tracing programs have triggered public concerns about privacy and surveillance .\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Janil Puthucheary , Minister-in-Charge of GovTech Singapore , voiced the new \u2018 token \u2019 will not track user location and the data collected on each device will be deleted after 25 days .\nThe adoption will also be voluntary .\nHowever , the government gave a totally different answer to the BBC , which reported that the Bluetooth \u2018 token \u2019 device \u201c helps elderly people keep a precise record of their whereabouts.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pretty clear by now that when governments make claims giving lipservice to fundamental issues like privacy and civil liberties \u2013 they are simply telling the press and people what is politically expedient for that moment in time .\nIn general , technocrats believe that concepts like personal privacy and rights are relative to the juggernaut of technology , and are really outdated relics of the past .\nTechnocracy \u2019 s ideology strongly believes brave new systems are needed to \u2018 face the challenges of the future.\n\u2019 Governments have now enabled an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but where does it end ?\nPeople should not be so naive as to think it will not be relatively easy for the state to convert these instruments of bio-surveillance into tools of social control and exclusion .\nWe \u2019 re seeing this unfold already in this COVID crisis .\nUnless people wake up to this fact and begin to push back , then governments and corporations will simply take their silence as implied consent to the new technocracy police state .\nSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

countries like the United Kingdom , the United States and Australia , is the intellectually dishonest claim that Coronavirus in their countries is somehow different from the Coronavirus in other western countries .\nIt \u2019 s like there are two parallel universes now .\nWhile the Anglosphere continues to ramp-up its emergency \u2018 pandemic \u2019 measures and mandatory mask and quarantine policies , their Scandinavian counterparts like Sweden , Norway or Denmark have already returned to life as normal ; no masks on public transport ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today advising masks on crowded carriages ) , no obsessive social distancing rules , no snap lockdowns , and certainly no draconian laws and threats of \u00a310,000 fines made by government leaders , or holding the country hostage until a wonder vaccine arrives in the spring .\nThe contrast couldn \u2019 t be more extreme .\nWhy has normality not returned to the US and UK ?\nPerhaps the worst aspect of the new hypochondriac culture being aggressively promoted in the US and UK is how the state bureaucrats and schools are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless regime of restrictive and nonsensical health and safety policies .\nOne of the main drivers of the school chaos in the UK has been the teachers/public service unions , who have seized on the crisis in order to leverage political power and carve out a platform in the national spotlight .\nUnion officials repeated the fallacious claim that schools were no longer safe unless a whole new raft of new rules , regulations and government assurances were put into place .\nThe list of issues and concerns keeps growing by the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education to a grinding halt .\nAs a result of this over-the-top fear-based approach to risk mitigation , the lives of students and their families across the UK have been unnecessarily disrupted .\nIn just the first few weeks of school , many thousands of students have already been removed from school and sent home and placed under under 14 day house arrest-quarantine order by school administrators \u2013 all because another student in school or a teacher had tested PCR positive for COVID .\nMany schools are also ordering all primary , secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house arrest at home over their half-term break , supposedly to \u201c stop the spread of the virus.\n\u201d British authorities have even gone so as to demand that university students remain on campus over the Christmas break in order \u201c stop the spread of COVID to their families back home.\n\u201d All of this is taking place at a time where hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID have dropped to near zero in the UK .\nIn other words : the \u2018 pandemic \u2019 , if it ever was one , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hospitalisations in the UK have plummeted , as have deaths attributed to COVID19 .\nStill , neither school or government health officials will readily admit the fact that young people at statistically at near zero risk of any complications due to COVID .\nLikewise , nearly all teachers fall well below the well-established elderly age-bracket risk zone .\nIn addition to this , UK officials still refuse to acknowledge that the PCR test is not only unreliable as a diagnostic tool for COVID , it also can not rightly identify whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case \u2019 or even an \u2018 infection.\n\u2019 This means that the entire mass-testing effort championed by governments is fatally flawed at source .\nThis is not up for debate , it is a scientific reality .\nBy contrast , from the very beginning of the crisis , Sweden never closed its schools and only required its university-aged students to temporarily migrate to remote teaching online .\nThe results for Sweden have been impressive \u2013 minimal or no interruption for millions of students nationwide during such a crucial stage in their formative educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been pursued in the US and UK , and the results have been catastrophic .\nUnlike in the UK , the Danish Teachers Union did not take to the media to try and hold government and schools hostage by threatening to strike if the State could not guarantee all schools were \u201d safe \u201d for teachers .\nInstead , there were sane and measured discussions , and genuine cooperation between the government and the teachers \u2019 unions .\nInterestingly , both parties allowed the schools to be the final authority on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education .\nDuring a recent discussion with CBC , Dorte Lange , VP of the Danish Teachers Union described the type of practical

amplification of the PCR .\nIt is telling us nothing about what the battle was , and we still don \u2019 t know how to tell the difference between the people who were really sick and the ones who have been cured .\nThe question now is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like a Russian or Chinese vaccine ?\nWe don \u2019 t know when it will come , from what country , and how safe it will be .\nSo the

disease for which we \u2019 ve improved the treatment ; in many places all over the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in mortality rates inside the hospitals\u2026 Things have improved for the patients .\nSo we have to decide if this is now a common infectious disease or is it something new ?\nDo we have to stay inside our bunkers , not going to school , and not providing the necessary finance for

falls by 10-20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society Trust in people and confidence in the future is at a much lower rate than what is seen in Sweden .\nYoung people are now the designated people for not just the transmission of the disease , but also the economic consequences which came directly from lockdown .\nAnd still we don \u2019 t have the absolute number of those who were saved by lockdown .\nWhat about the people who are dying from being isolated without human contact with their families ?\nAnd suicides ?\nWe have had a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are focused on the positive effects of this isolation .\nThe Oxford study shows there is no relation at all between the stringency of lockdown and mortality rate in the 188 countries that have declared at least one case of Covid .\nOn the

the limits of development for the human species .\nInterestingly , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 20-55 degree northern latitude , which stretches from Japan to the United States and includes all the European countries .\nThese countries had the highest development rates in the twentieth century but they have experienced for the last two decades some plateauing in many parameters : health , life

the most exciting and perilous continent on the planet at that time , South America , with no less than five major uprisings taking place at once , in Chile , Colombia , Bolivia , Ecuador , as well as resonant political toggling happening in Brazil , Argentina , Mexico , Nicaragua , and of course Venezuela , a country he cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your finger on the pulse of the Latin street , it was the place to be , and so it goes without saying that Andre would slide into the milieu .\nSomewhere in between the Andes and The Levant , Andre managed to do another Herculian loop around Asia , filing a series of eye-watering reports from locations like Philippines , Vietnam , Malaysia , and Indonesia .\nFor me personally , this was an incredible masterclass in 21st century Asian affairs .\nFrom his reporting in Malaysia , I learned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deforestation and corporate takeover by palm oil plantations which have turned the country into a giant foreign cash crop .\nIndeed , Andre had a rare talent for telling the untold .\nHe would call it as he saw , and would rarely mince words .\nIn his documentary film Downfall !\nhe described the US-backed coup in Indonesia in 1965 as an \u201c intellectual and cultural Hiroshima.\n\u201d Whether it was the graphic post-mortems of globalized late-stage capitalism , or NATO \u2019 s pillaging of Central Asia and the Middle East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the skin of the prevailing narrative , no doubt causing an awful itch for the superficial western consensus reality .\nIn Borneo , it was literally eye-watering , after he contracted a near deadly parasite infection in his eye which required medical treatment which he was not able to get locally , but eventually got treated after he left the country .\nBut it hardly slowed him down .\nOff to another jungle , or the next simmering war zone or uprising .\nFollowing his last Asian sweep , he was confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Santiago , under the cosh of the harsh national lockdown imposed by Chile \u2019 s neoliberal government led by Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era .\nOur radio interviews from South America in March 2020 , \u2018 Panic , Lockdown , Backlash \u2019 and later in June , \u2018 Chile \u2019 s brutal \u2018 Corona Coup \u2019 were among the best segments we \u2019 ve ever aired .\nPreviously , in one of our first full-length radio interviews recorded in October 2019 , Andre deconstructed the gambit of popular uprisings in Hong Kong , Ecuador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would witness firsthand in Bolivia the aftermath of the US-sponsored , fascist beer hall putsch and flight of deposed President Evo Morales , and told the important story of a marginalised indigenous population based in Altiplano , as they gathered themselves preparing to restore the country \u2019 s rightful government .\nIt was absolutely stunning reporting .\nIt was Andre \u2019 s raw emotion anchored by a special documentarian eye for detail which made his segments so captivating .\nI regard his piece on the global lockdown as seminal , titled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Fragmented World , Has Ruined Billions of Lives , where he captured the global zeitgeist and the pungent sombre mood of the moment .\nAndre made sure we all remembered that , too .\nI was always impressed how Andre was able to quickly embed himself in any area or situation , taking its political pulse .\nAndre was able to compare and contrast political movements in different locations .\nThis brought a level of richness and depth to Andre \u2019 s work , and it \u2019 s one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic and engaging , as it unearthed another massive side to global politics absent from the corporate media \u2013 leftwing and socialist movements , virtually invisible in pro-western mainstream press and punditry .\nHow can you cover , or pretend to know what \u2019 s happening on the ground without this perspective ?\nThe answer is you can not , and for this reason I believed his perspective provided an important balance to our coverage of global affairs .\nThe fact that we shared similar anti-imperialist and anti-elitist perspectives , and that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to self-determination , allowed for a level of fluidity along geopolitical editorial lines .\nIt also helped that we were both well-versed in western soft power and \u2018 smart power \u2018 subterfuge \u2013 enough to be able tell a real revolution from a western-backed colour revolution .\nHowever , we did not always see eye to eye ideologically , and so we had our share of heated political discussions .\nHis ardor was undeniable though \u2013 you could never contain him within the tidy frame of journalist , reporter or filmmaker .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nBy his own admission , Andre was a committed internationalist , in the Cuban sense .\nHe strongly believed that if one is to cultivate real political awareness , then it should start with having an international perspective , because imperialism , as a de facto continuation of colonialism , is the fundamental source of pain and suffering in the developing world .\nHe was strongly committed to international socialism , explained in his own words in an emotional manifesto , published with his quintessential gusto in 2016 , and unabashedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist.\n\u201d Andre believed strongly that as internationalist state actors , countries like Cuba are front-runners in the spirit of international cooperation and therefore are fundamentally a force for good in the world .\nRegardless of one \u2019 s political preference , it \u2019 s difficult to deny how many times Cuba ( a country under US embargo for over 60 years and with relatively few resources ) has led the way in providing international aid or medical assistance to locations in crisis \u2013 often in places which were routinely eschewed by sanctimonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to highlight these , along with similar missions undertaken by socialist governments from Venezuela and North Korea , as well as similar effort by China .\nWestern critics of those efforts will claim these are not real humanitarian efforts , but rather , a state propaganda exercises designed to curry favor with a global audience .\nTo this point , Andre would point out that you \u2019 d be hard-pressed to find a state actor on the international stage that is not engaged in some kind of soft power operations overseas .\nActors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not only engaged in such efforts , but do so with bottomless tranches of funding and resources \u2013 on the aggregate exceeding all of the other countries combined .\nAll of which makes the relatively small but hugely symbolic efforts of countries like Cuba all the more impressive in comparison \u2013 winning hearts and minds the old fashioned way , through hard work , human-to-human organisation , and above all a dedication to their mission of service .\nAndre had the same mission : running towards trouble and strife , offering nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and camera lens , with a deep conviction that by doing so he could make the world a better place .\nBut he was no naive revolutionary .\nHe knew the flaws and shortcomings of conventional politics , and offered some of the most brutal critiques of western leftism and the ascendancy of the neoliberal radical centrists .\nIn that sense , he was a realist on the Left .\nI admit , we had some brutal arguments over editorial issues .\nI had to wear my editor \u2019 s hat , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , I \u2019 d so often prefer to be in Andre \u2019 s boots ; swashbuckling and intrepid , fighting for my convictions , and making my case to the editor to publish \u2018 all of it , \u2019 and be damned .\nOf course , Andre knew the score , certainly no stranger to the nature of relations between writer and editor were always bound to be inherently attenuate .\nEven so , his hard-headed nature meant that he would never readily accept the uncanny bureaucratic alchemy of the editorial room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him such an exceptional reporter , raconteur and witness extraordinaire .\nIt \u2019 s hard to conceive just how prolific he was , and how much we can still learn from his work .\nAndre was on the ground in Hong Kong throughout most of the umbrella protests , exposing time and time again how the violent \u2018 pro-democracy \u2019 mobs lauded by the BBC and CNN were being marshaled by Joshua Wong and actually had the full backing of the US State Department and all of its soft power assets .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Hooligans : Western Shock Troops \u2018 contains some unforgettable imagery .\nSimilarly , in the Middle East he revealed how , since 2012 the US and its allies have been using the radical jihadi fighters from China \u2019 s Uyghur community in Xinjiang as proxy fighters to fight their dirty war in Syria .\nHe was also on the ground in the Philippines in 2017 , and knew that ISIS fighters , arms and money were being injected into Marawi with an aim to destabilise the Duterte government for not obeying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert nation-building by the West is rarely if ever covered by mainstream media , but it was Andre \u2019 s stock and trade .\nAs a denizen of the world , Andre was always monitoring the trajectory of political movements on the ground , but he also took the time to take the cultural temperature too .\nHe was always keenly aware of his environment ; the art scene , local music , underground cafe culture , poetry and literature , and the independent cinema , and the quality and potency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political vibrancy , and potential for change .\nTo less observant journalists , such particulars would dissolve in passing \u2013 taken for granted as mere background noise , but Andre always paid attention to them .\nPerhaps that \u2019 s what drew me to Andre \u2019 s style of reporting to begin with , as I tend to follow the same interpretivist methodology when I travel or report on location .\nIt \u2019 s why I really appreciated Andre \u2019 s razor-edged , gonzo-style of journalism .\nRead any of his articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in texture between his work and everyone else \u2019 s .\nHis accompanying photography is also unique , always giving the reader a real feel for the place and its people , but always , always against a vivid political backdrop .\nStill hope : \u201c Afghanistan can still fly \u201d ( Image Credit : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2017 ) In a world dominated by desktop journalists and plastic pundits , he was the genuine article , our man in the field \u2013 shades of Hemmingway and Steinbeck , with some Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andre wasn \u2019 t afraid to insert himself and situations , and sometime push a situation and people to the limit in a way that so many great writers and artists so often do , feeling ( and knowing ) they have the power to reform the discourse and thus , change the way people see the world .\nI recall during our conversations how often Andre would so lament the noticeable disappearance of the dissident intellectuals on the scene \u2013 the poets , the composers , the artists\u2026 the dreamers , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame of revolution through the ages .\nThose who are ready will stand up for liberty , justice and equality , and demand the restoration of dignity for a people abused by an unforgiving Hobbesian system .\nPolitically speaking , in our increasingly homogenized and globalised 21st century political economy , they are an endangered species .\nNo doubt , Andre was ( and still is ) a keeper of that flame .\nIn all of my years working in media and journalism , I have never known anyone who was as passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He certainly wasn \u2019 t a careerist in search of mainstream acceptance and accolades from the liberal establishment .\nNo desire for the champagne socialist circuit ; the ingratiating Guardian and Frontline Club panel discussions , the TED talks , and the usual human rights NGO junkets .\nHe wasn \u2019 t even remotely interested in that world , which was why he was shut-out by the \u2018 great and the good \u2019 manning the gates of corporate mainstream media .\nAnd yet , he stands head and shoulders above them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 18 books , including a collaborative work with Noam Chomsky entitled , On Western Terrorism , produced and directed documentaries films , wrote stage plays , as well as penned several hundred feature articles for a variety of publications worldwide .\nHe exuded the youthful exuberance and spirit of adventure which you \u2019 d be hard-pressed to find in any journalist half his age .\nBeyond his sheer talent as a reporter , he was a witness to events and people , intimately involved in his research subjects , and absolutely believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on location , could somehow help to steer events towards a more positive outcome \u2013 by virtue of his telling the story which wasn \u2019 t being told , by lending his voice to the voiceless .\nHe wrote from the heart , and was never ashamed about it .\nIn that sense , you could say he was journalism \u2019 s one true revolutionary .\nAndre always struck me as akin to that rare breed of warrior known in lore , who preferred to die with honour on the battlefield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parades post factum .\nIf you asked Andre , he would tell you he was just doing his duty as a human being .\nVirtues aside , who ever wants to see a colleague , friend , or comrade , fall in battle .\nIt surely reminds us of what a relatively ephemeral ball of fire our lives really are , along with the mourning knowing that they won \u2019 t be around for the next conflagration , or to see victory in their lifetime .\nPerhaps Andre never expected to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed that at the end of day , all there is , is the fight .\nAnd more often than not , it \u2019 s that spirit which defines us .\nNot whether we won or lost , but how hard we fought , who we fought for , and why .\nSuch is the way of a warrior .\n*** Author Andre Vltchek has worked for over 25 years as an

concerns about the damaging physical , and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection .\nComing from both the left and right , and around the world , we have devoted our careers to protecting people .\nCurrent lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health .\nThe results ( to name a few ) include lower childhood vaccination rates , worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health \u2013 leading to greater excess mortality in years to come , with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden .\nKeeping students out of school is a grave injustice .\nKeeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable

higher in the old and infirm than the young .\nIndeed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other harms , including influenza .\nAs immunity builds in the population , the risk of infection to all \u2013 including

the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection , while better protecting those who are

measures , such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-person teaching .\nExtracurricular activities ,

for fanatical lockdown governments in the UK , Australia and Spain , as well as in states like New York .\nYesterday , WHO lead official Dr. David Nabarro appealed to world leaders to stop \u201c using lockdowns as your primary control method \u201d of suppressing COVID-19 .\n\u201c Lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle , and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer , \u201d said Dr. Nabarro .\nHe went on to warn western governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing \u2013 unnecessary poverty and suffering .\nAt no point did he state that medieval-style lockdown measures have \u2018 saved lives.\n\u2019 This goes directly against repeated statements by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , who has advocating for lockdowns all along , saying that , \u201c [ L ] ockdowns enabled many countries to suppress transmission and take the pressure off their health systems.\n\u201d However , increased economic and social devastation from WHO policy recommendations has triggered a wave of dissent across the world as more people begin to realise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with .\nDuring a recent interview with British magazine , The Spectator , Dr Nabarro said , \u201c We in the World Health Organisation do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus.\n\u201d The intention of his statement was clear , as he categorically rebuked the use of lockdowns by authoritarian governments in the UK and elsewhere : \u201c The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganise , regroup , rebalance your resources , protect your health workers who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 d rather not do it.\n\u201d He also blamed reckless lockdown policies and obsessive travel restrictions as being responsible for decimating delicate economies which rely on tourism to survive , as well as strangling small farmers in poorer regions : \u201c Just look at what \u2019 s happened to the tourism industry in the Caribbean , for example , or in the Pacific because people aren \u2019 t taking their holidays.\n\u201d \u201c Look what \u2019 s happened to smallholder farmers all over the world .\n\u2026 Look what \u2019 s @ @ @

for doing it .\nWork together and learn from each other.\n\u201d Dr Nabarro \u2019 s message has come just a week after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a group of the world \u2019 s top epidemiologists including

the country \u2019 s greatest and most enduring institutions , the British pub .\nDue to a raft of draconian government COVID policies , the country \u2019 s hospitality industry is now crumbling ( along with tens of thousands of jobs ) , and with Boris Johnson \u2019 s government standing over it \u2013 seemingly eager to deliver the final death blow this winter .\nBesides the economic devastation , the issue is becoming increasingly divisive to society \u2013 indicative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGovernment cuts in operating hours have meant a substantial loss of income for independent business already on the ropes from forced lockdowns over spring and summer .\nMoreover , with pubs only open for limited service but with large crowds , it also raises questions of policy inconsistency like : why are pubs allowed to open and not gyms ?\nWhy is the State \u2019 s notorious \u201c Rule of Six \u201d not applicable to pubs , but supposedly enforced in people \u2019 s homes , and even outdoors in parks ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pubs , but health ministers and NHS have barred partners from accompanying pregnant women for scans or appointments , and not even allowed to attend an early labour session ?\nMeanwhile , the Government and mainstream media have cleverly framed the argument to set people against each other , as \u201c one person \u2019 s laxity or enjoyment is ever more taken as a direct insult to another person \u2019 s caution.\n\u201d This , along with a clear concerted effort by media to disingenuously blame young people and their social lives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 while they routinely fail to mention that youth are at near zero risk of any health complications from carrying a coronavirus .\nSCOTCHED EARTH POLICY : Prime Minster Boris Johnson and his Health Minister Matt Hancock presiding over the wholesale destruction of UK hospitality and entertainment industries .\nIn the end , it is the reactionary Government policy decisions , and not COVID-19 itself , which is currently crushing British society and culture .\nhave some sympathy with politicians trying to make evidence-based decisions in unprecedented times .\nThe wheels of peer-reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specific policy measures , such as what to do with the hospitality industry during Covid-19 , we are in uncharted territory .\nNevertheless , it does not inspire confidence when the Chief Medical Officer , Chris Whitty , is passing around a dodgy dossier in private meetings with MPs .\nWhitty seems determined to find evidence that pubs are a significant source of transmission , so they can be closed down .\nWhen the Scottish Government announced the closure of most of its pubs on Wednesday , it could only muster the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with the virus had visited a hospitality venue in the past week .\nScotland \u2019 s Chief Medical Officer admitted that this did not prove that any of them had been infected in a pub , nor that they had infected anyone else in a pub .\nCorrelation doesn \u2019 t equal causation and this was barely even a correlation .\nWithout knowing how many non-infected people go to the pub each week , the statistic is meaningless .\nMore useful are the NHS Test and Trace figures showing where infected people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ with other people ] and places they have visited \u2019 .\nThe most common exposure , by far , is in the home .\nOnly 5 per cent of individuals with the virus report having had close contact with other people in what Public Health England unhelpfully classifies \u2018 leisure/community \u2019 .\nThis is an extremely broad category that lumps together \u2018 eating out , attending events and celebrations , exercising , worship , arts , entertainment or recreation , community activities and attending play groups or organised trips \u2019 .\nDespite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one in twenty Covid-19 cases mention having been involved in any of them .\nThe number of people who visited a pub specifically must be significantly lower than five per cent and the number of people who were infected in them lower still .\nThe 10pm \u2018 curfew \u2019 is now widely acknowledged to be a mistake .\nEmpirical evidence is again lacking , but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that it has led to crowds on public transport and an increase in house parties .\nIt is easy to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if pubs are closed down altogether .\nWhen the curfew began two weeks ago , the seven day average of new Covid-19 cases was running at around 6,000 .\nIt has since doubled .\nIn Bolton , pubs have been closed since 8 September .\nWhen the shutdown began , the seven day average was running at 88 new cases per day .\nIt now stands at 109 .\nPubs reopened nationwide on 4 July , but it was not until late August that the virus began to grow significantly .\nIn Leicester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet the rate of infection continued falling in the city until September when , in common with rest of the country , there was a resurgence .\nIn short , there is vanishingly little evidence to support the idea that shutting down highly regulated hospitality venues breaks the cycle of transmission .\nIt might even make things worse .\nInstead of resorting to a socially damaging and economically disastrous shutdown of the hospitality industry , the government should revisit these measures , strengthen them based on lessons learnt , and ensure consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telegraph SUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

grilled Michael Pack , who President Trump recently appointed to head the US government \u2019 s state propaganda arm , the US Agency for Global Media ( USAGM ) .\nPack was appointed in June and started a big shakeup at the US state media outlets run by the USAGM , like Voice of America and Radio Free Asia .\nPack fired senior staffers , pushed out management , and froze funding .\nDuring last week \u2019 s hearing , Democrats and Republicans on the committee teamed up to attack Pack for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to Congress and former USAGM officials was Pack \u2019 s move to freeze funds to the Open Technology Fund ( OTF ) .\nThe OTF was formed in 2012 and operated as part of Radio Free Asia for seven years .\nIn 2019 , the OTF became an independent non-profit , although it is

to serve support for circumvention tools and expand support for digital training.\n\u201d Kornbluh explained that the USAGM froze OTF funds before China \u2019 s national security law for Hong Kong came into effect .\n\u201c And then USAGM froze , and continues to withhold , its funding \u2013 and did that just weeks before the new security laws came into effect , \u201d Kornbluh said .\n\u201c

According to Time , this initiative has already made several payouts to groups in Hong Kong since the civil unrest began in June 2019 .\nThe cut in funding inadvertently revealed the US government

media , that hardly anyone can attain to the inward detachment that is required for a clear view of the monstrous drama .\nThe will-to-power operating under a pure democratic disguise has finished off its masterpiece so well that the object \u2019 s sense of freedom is actually flattered by the most thorough-going enslavement that has ever existed.\n\u201d \u2013 Oswald Spengler , The Decline of the West ( 1928 ) Seven months into this crisis , it can \u2019 t be any clearer .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ western governments are using the COVID \u2018 pandemic \u2019 crisis as a pretext to usher in whole new layer of security state bureaucracy , and one which has the power to penetrate more deeply into our lives .\nFor those who are old enough to remember , prior to September 11 , 2001 , there was no such thing as a Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , and yet in a matter of a few years , this federal department quickly grew into one of the largest federal agencies taking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ever since .\nIn fact , the term Homeland didn \u2019 t even exist in America before that .\nBut it was the perceived threat which provided it \u2019 s raison d \u2019 etre \u2013 buttressed by an incessant barrage of propaganda by the state and its media adjuncts , which made this new paradigm a reality .\nSoon , all of these new state apparatuses and security initiatives where all nestled neatly under the new banner of the Global War on Terror .\nIn 2020 , this exact process has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t the spectre of radical Islamist terror coming from foreign lands , but something much closer to home .\nAccording to our governments , the new threat is your neighbour , your teacher , the shopkeeper , and even your family members .\nAnd you are a threat to each of them .\nAnd everyone is a threat to each other .\nI described this dialectic in the recent special edition of New Dawn Magazine .\nHere \u2019 s a brief passage from my article entitled , \u201c THE GREAT RESET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d : This week , the UK Government announced its latest round of emergency measure and regional lockdowns , supposedly for fighting the coronavirus .\nTheir new \u201c Tier Three \u201d lockdown system will determine whether towns or cities will be allowed to keep pubs , gyms and other leisure facilities open , for up to a further six months .\nBut who knows when it will end .\nThis has prompted concerned members of public , along with a few brave officials , to ask who exactly is setting this new Three-Tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new system will classify regions as either \u2018 medium \u2019 , \u2018 high \u2019 or \u2018 very high \u2019 levels , with high and above triggering new local lockdowns .\nWelcome to thin end of the state \u2019 s bio-surveillance wedge .\nSimilar protocols are being rolled out in Five Eyes Alliance nations the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .\nJust as with the global war on terror , governments have now erected an entirely new level within the ever-expanding national security state .\nIn the UK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Centre ( JBC ) , formed in July , and already a \u00a39 billion operation .\nExpect that number to grow substantially as the security complex discovers new and more complex systems required to keep pace with a new global bio surveillance and biological arms race .\n\u201c Led by a senior spy , the JBC does not publish details of its deliberations , the sources of its evidence or its key personnel .\nNevertheless , its advice to ministers is understood to have guided recent decisions on where to enforce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , \u201d said The Telegraph .\nIs COVID really so deadly that the state needs to reconfigure all of its public health agencies under a new command and control hierarchy ?\nIndeed , many asked the same question about al-Qaeda 20 years ago .\nUnfortunately , few officials are demanding any answers or calling for accountability .\nThere is only one such inquisitive public servant so far , Dr Greg Clark MP , Chairman of Science and Technology Committee , who believes that the British public are owed some answers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which person ( s ) is making the final decisions for these rather arbitrary \u2018 alert levels \u2019 being issued by the government .\nExactly what is the remit of this new JBC ?\nAccording to the Institute for Government : And just as we suspected , here \u2019 s the salient point : The current Three-Tier alert system was based on the following framework devised for the JBC in determining new Covid-19 alert levels : \u2022 Level 1 : Covid-19 is not known to be present in the UK \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK , but the number of cases and transmission is low \u2022 Level 4 : a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation ; transmission is high or rising exponentially \u2022 Level 5 : as level 4 and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed .\nIf it looks and sounds like a military operation , that \u2019 s because it is .\nThis is the first time that the science of epidemiology has been brushed aside in favour of a one-size-fits-all , military-style approach to mitigating a viral pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only providing recommendations \u201c informed by the data collected and analysed by the JBC.\n\u201d It is therefore up to Downing Street and its chief medical officer to issue the final alert level .\nPresumably they will be processing testing data , along with NHS Track and Trace , as well as data from the Office of National Statistics , and Public Health England ( if it still exists ) .\nWe \u2019 re told that the JBC is being headed by an intelligence chief from GCHQ , cybersecurity director Dr Clare Gardiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a \u201c qualified epidemiologist , medical researcher , and cybersecurity director.\n\u201d The Telegraph adds , \u201c She reports to Baroness Dido Harding , the chief of NHS Test and Trace , while the entire JBC organisation falls under the control of the Department of Health , which answers to the Mr Hancock .\nGovernment sources insisted the body was largely staffed by civil servants meaning it was \u201c not appropriate \u201d to release their identities.\n\u201d Lockdowns are no trivial matter and deeply impact the lives of millions of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave economic and social consequences .\nThey also cost lives .\nHence , the concern here is one of transparency , and it is unknown if this new \u2018 bio-intelligence \u2019 agency will be engaging with independent scientists , or will it merely collate data and liase with government-appoint science advisors .\nIt seems odd to be blending the civil service and signals intelligence with the science departments .\nFrom a political and bureaucratic point of view , it \u2019 s certainly convenient for politicians to have yet another compartment to whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use plausible deniability for obfuscation purposes .\nIf nothing else , it gives Ministers yet another panel of \u2018 experts \u2019 to defer to \u2013 the familiar illusion of impressive depth and deep considerations supposedly informing the Ministers \u2019 final assessments \u2013 when in reality , it just becomes more convoluted .\nDrowning in unaccountable bureaucracy .\nThat \u2019 s where the epic mistakes are usual made .\nJust as with the disastrous War on Terror , there is a serious danger that an entirely new division of security state technocracy will inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own bubble within an already knotted civil service , and propelled by endless feedback loops \u2013 creating more problems than were there to begin with .\nIt \u2019 s important to point out that such historic and sweeping changes in government can only be achieved amid a climate of fear .\nSince the beginning of this crisis , the mainstream media have been dedicated to delivering that fear .\nDuring the War on Terror , the media scooped up whatever government and the intelligence community were serving , and just ran with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never have realised any of its newfound powers .\nIt \u2019 s the same now with COVID .\nYou need only to replace the anti-terror mavens in intelligence community with The Science committees .\nThis is precisely \u2018 the intellectual artillery \u2019 of government joined-up with the media , which Spengler warned about almost a century ago in his treatise , The Decline of the West .\nMake no mistake about it \u2013 freedom and democracy are under attack from a new and revitalised , COVID-inspired security industrial complex .\nJudging by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being willing to hold any of the Five Eyes government to account for their horrendous performances thus far , it seems unlikely that the media will challenge this new bio-security arm that much .\nOne can only hope the penny drops much sooner with this leviathan , than it has with previous security state

.\nThis week a Michigan Supreme Court ruled in favor of the people by effectively rebuking efforts by the state \u2019 s Democrat Governor , Gretchen Whitmer , to impose a new state-wide lockdown

days \u2013 until after the General Election on November 3rd , but the Court saw through this maneuver and proceeded to reject Whitmer \u2019 s attempted delay on Monday .\nThis latest legal drama

statement after the ruling on October 2 , Whitmer claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this ruling does not take effect for at least 21 days , and until then , my emergency declaration and orders retain the force of law.\n\u201d She called the ruling \u201c deeply disappointing.\n\u201d The governor \u2019 s attorneys later asked for 28 days to give the administration time to negotiate with lawmakers and put new restrictions in place .\nYet on Monday , the court ruled that the 21-day rule does not apply in this case because the ruling came in response to questions from a federal judge who sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s actions , Crain \u2019 s Detroit Business reported .\nChief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack wrote , \u201c I do not believe the court has the authority to grant the remedy the governor

\u2019 s health department director has imposed a new mask mandate and restrictions for public-facing businesses and gatherings under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope of the legal challenge .\nThe Oct. 2 ruling condemned the excessive sweep of Whitmer \u2019 s lockdown , noting that a wide variety of businesses had to close as a result of her orders , including \u201c restaurants , food courts , cafes

totalitarianism is mass conformity to a psychotic official narrative .\nNot a regular official narrative , like the \u201c Cold War \u201d or the \u201c War on Terror \u201d narratives .\nA totally delusional official narrative that has little or no connection to reality and that is contradicted by a preponderance of facts .\nNazism and Stalinism are the classic examples , but the phenomenon is better observed in cults and other sub-cultural societal groups .\nNumerous examples will spring to mind : the Manson family , Jim Jones \u2019 People \u2019 s Temple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc.\n, each with its own psychotic official narrative : Helter Skelter , Christian Communism , Xenu and the Galactic Confederacy , and so on .\nLooking in from the dominant culture ( or back through time in the case of the Nazis ) , the delusional nature of these official narratives is glaringly obvious to most rational people .\nWhat many people fail to understand is that to those who fall prey to them ( whether individual cult members or entire totalitarian societies ) such narratives do not register as psychotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely normal .\nEverything in their social \u201c reality \u201d reifies and reaffirms the narrative , and anything that challenges or contradicts it is perceived as an existential threat .\nThese narratives are invariably paranoid , portraying the cult as threatened or persecuted by an evil enemy or antagonistic force which only unquestioning conformity to the cult \u2019 s ideology can save its members from .\nIt makes little difference whether this antagonist is mainstream culture , body thetans , counter-revolutionaries , Jews , or a virus .\nThe point is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the atmosphere of paranoia and hysteria the official narrative generates , which keeps the cult members ( or the society ) compliant .\nIn addition to being paranoid , these narratives are often internally inconsistent , illogical , and \u2026 well , just completely ridiculous .\nThis does not weaken them , as one might suspect .\nActually , it increases their power , as it forces their adherents to attempt to reconcile their inconsistency and irrationality , and in many cases utter absurdity , in order to remain in good standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course impossible , and causes the cult members \u2019 minds to short circuit and abandon any semblance of critical thinking , which is precisely what the cult leader wants .\nMoreover , cult leaders will often radically change these narratives for no apparent reason , forcing their cult members to abruptly forswear ( and often even denounce as \u201c heresy \u201d ) the beliefs they had previously been forced to profess , and behave as if they had never believed them , which causes their minds to further short circuit , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think rationally , and just mindlessly parrot whatever nonsensical gibberish the cult leader fills their heads with .\nAlso , the cult leader \u2019 s nonsensical gibberish is not as nonsensical as it may seem at first .\nMost of us , upon encountering such gibberish , assume that the cult leader is trying to communicate , and that something is very wrong with his brain .\nThe cult leader isn \u2019 t trying to communicate .\nHe is trying to disorient and control the listener \u2019 s mind .\nListen to Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says , but how he says it .\nNote how he sprinkles bits of truth into his stream of free-associated nonsense , and his repetitive use of thought-terminating clich\u00e9s , described by Robert J. Lifton as follows : If all this sounds familiar , good .\nBecause the same techniques that most cult leaders use to control the minds of the members of their cults are used by totalitarian systems to control the minds of entire societies : Milieu Control , Loaded Language , Sacred Science , Demand for Purity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen to pretty much any society , just as anyone can fall prey to a cult , given the right set of circumstances .\nIt is happening to most of our societies right now .\nAn official narrative is being implemented .\nA totalitarian official narrative .\nA totally psychotic official narrative , no less delusional than that of the Nazis , or the Manson family , or any other cult .\nMost people can not see that it is happening , for the simple reason that it is happening to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nThe human mind is extremely resilient and inventive when it is pushed past its limits .\nAsk anyone who has struggled with psychosis or has taken too much LSD .\nWe do not recognize when we are going insane .\nWhen reality falls apart completely , the mind will create a delusional narrative , which appears just as \u201c real \u201d as our normal reality , because even a delusion is better than the stark raving terror of utter chaos .\nThis is what totalitarians and cult leaders count on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds , and why actual initiation rituals ( as opposed to purely symbolic rituals ) begin by attacking the subject \u2019 s mind with terror , pain , physical exhaustion , psychedelic drugs , or some other means of obliterating the subject \u2019 s perception of reality .\nOnce that is achieved , and the subject \u2019 s mind starts desperately trying to construct a new narrative to make sense out of the cognitive chaos and psychological trauma it is undergoing , it is relatively easy to \u201c guide \u201d that process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming you have done your homework .\nAnd this is why so many people \u2014 people who are able to easily recognize totalitarianism in cults and foreign countries \u2014 can not perceive the totalitarianism that is taking shape now , right in front of their faces ( or , rather , right inside their minds ) .\nNor can they perceive the delusional nature of the official \u201c Covid-19 \u201d narrative , no more than those in Nazi Germany were able to perceive how completely delusional their official \u201c master race \u201d narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor stupid .\nThey have been successfully initiated into a cult , which is essentially what totalitarianism is , albeit on a societal scale .\nTheir initiation into the Covidian Cult began in January , when the medical authorities and corporate media turned on The Fear with projections of hundreds of millions of deaths and fake photos of people dropping dead in the streets .\nThe psychological conditioning has continued for months .\nThe global masses have been subjected to a constant stream of propaganda , manufactured hysteria , wild speculation , conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tawdry theatrical effects .\nLockdowns .\nEmergency field hospitals and morgues .\nThe singing-dancing NHS staff .\nDeath trucks .\nOverflowing ICUs .\nDead Covid babies .\nManipulated statistics .\nGoon squads .\nMasks .\nAnd all the rest of it .\nEight months later , here we are .\nThe Head of the Health Emergencies Program at the WHO has basically confirmed an IFR of 0.14 % , approximately the same as the seasonal flu .\nAnd here are the latest survival rate estimates from the Center for Disease Control : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAn increasing number of doctors and medical experts are breaking ranks and explaining how the current mass hysteria over \u201c cases \u201d ( which now includes perfectly healthy people ) is essentially meaningless propaganda , for example , in this segment on ARD , one of the big mainstream German TV channels .\nAnd then there is the existence of Sweden , and other countries which are not playing ball with the official Covid-19 narrative , which makes a mockery of the ongoing hysteria .\nI \u2019 m not going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the facts are all available .\nNot from \u201c conspiracy theorist \u201d websites .\nFrom mainstream outlets and medical experts .\nFrom the Center for Fucking Disease Control .\nWhich does not matter in the least , not to the members of the Covidian Cult .\nFacts do not matter to totalitarians and cult members .\nWhat matters is loyalty to the cult or the party .\nWhich means we have a serious problem , those of us to whom facts still matter , and who have been trying to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are wrong about the virus \u2026 for going on eight months at this point .\nWhile it is crucial to continue reporting the facts and sharing them with as many people as possible \u2014 which is becoming increasingly difficult due to the censorship of alternative and social media \u2014 it is important to accept what we are up against .\nWhat we are up against is not a misunderstanding or a rational argument over scientific facts .\nIt is a fanatical ideological movement .\nA global totalitarian movement \u2026 the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t national totalitarianism , because we \u2019 re living in a global capitalist empire , which isn \u2019 t ruled by nation-states , but rather , by supranational entities and the global capitalist system itself .\nAnd thus , the cult/culture paradigm has been inverted .\nInstead of the cult existing as an island within the dominant culture , the cult has become the dominant culture , and those of us who have not joined the cult have become the isolated islands within it .\nI wish I could be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plan of action , but the only historical parallel I can think of is how Christianity \u201c converted \u201d the pagan world \u2026 which doesn \u2019 t really bode so well for us .\nWhile you \u2019 re sitting at home during the \u201c second wave \u201d lockdowns , you might want to brush up on that history .\n*** C.J .\nHopkins is an award-winning American playwright , novelist and political satirist .\nHis plays have been produced and have toured at theatres and

decision to extend his precarious lockdown policies into the summer .\nThere were some individual voices like Peter Hitchens , Allison Pearson , Freddy Forsyth and others , by their voices were systematically marginalized , and thus remained relatively isolated as a result .\nBut the tide appears to have turned this week though .\nThe Mail on Sunday , one of Britain \u2019 s major Sunday publications , issued a stern rebuke to the Government today in its editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is most comprehensive and decisive take-down of the state \u2019 s reactionary , authoritarian \u2018 New Normal \u2019 regime .\nKudos to this paper \u2019 s editorial team for pushing back against a Government who continue to brazenly accuses its subjects of \u2018 misbehaving \u2019 for simply engaging in what is now deemed the criminal act of living their normal lives .\nReaders can only hope this is only the first wave of salvos by the mainstream press on behalf of the people\u2026 MAIL ON SUNDAY COMMENT : Powerful voices now argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of learning to live with the virus\u2026 We urge the PM to listen The measures now being imposed on large parts of the country would be severe and hard to bear if we had reason to believe that they would do any good .\nThe trouble is that we have no shred of solid evidence that they will help at all .\nThe vast illogical web of new rules , increasingly impossible to understand or follow , looks worryingly like an exasperated attempt to punish us for wanting to live normal lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub if you are prepared to eat a large unhealthy meal with your drink , but not otherwise .\nGo to the gym in Manchester but not in Liverpool .\nWear a mask while you walk to your restaurant table , but not while you sit down .\nIt would take the late Professor Albert Einstein to work out the latest combination of regulations on who we can or can not see , mix with or meet , in the open air or indoors .\nAnd by the time the great physicist had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rules would have changed again .\nThe alleged scientific basis for this is weak beyond belief , as Sir Keir Starmer pointed out before throwing all reason and logic aside and demanding still more stringent collective punishments , which would incidentally make even more Labour voters unemployed .\nIn 19 out of the 20 places already compelled to suffer under strict regimes , no benefit was observed .\nAnd why should it be ?\nWhen we were first beguiled into this new way of life by an appeal to our benevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few weeks of self-restraint we would save the NHS from being overwhelmed .\nWho could resist such a plea ?\nMillions cheerfully surrendered treasured freedoms for the common good , thinking they would soon get them back when the job was done .\nThe NHS was not overwhelmed ( and it is far from clear that it ever would have been ) .\nBut the weeks passed , and what happened ?\nWe had a serious case of mission creep .\nSomehow the task had now become one never previously attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual suppression of the virus itself .\nWe were not free to return to our normal lives .\nOn the contrary , every few days brought a new alleged alarm .\nA testy and increasingly petulant Matt Hancock , the Health Secretary , did not release us from our bonds .\nRestrictions applied on the pretext of safety or security are notoriously hard to get rid of , and these were no exception .\nOnly after immense damage had been done to the economy were we allowed to resume something like normal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked by sudden quarantine clampdowns , though no significant evidence has been produced that travellers returning from these supposedly dangerous countries were in fact suffering from or carrying the disease .\nHardly were the surviving pubs and restaurants and hairdressers open again , and high streets beginning to function , when the Government began to voice fears of a supposed \u2018 second wave \u2019 of Covid , and moves to get us back to work were halted .\nIndeed , the Government tried very hard to find such a second wave , launching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who could be said to be infected by the virus .\nThe key fact about Covid-19 , that it is rarely harmful to those much under 70 years of age , and then mainly when they have severe underlying conditions , seemed never to imprint itself on Mr Hancock \u2019 s memory .\nHe also seemed incapable of noticing that the great bulk of the positive test \u2018 cases \u2019 of which he makes so much involved people who were and remained perfectly well .\nThe reassuring facts , that doctors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively , that many hospitalisations tend to be brief , that many people are now recovering after successful treatments and the use of new and effective drugs , were likewise somehow underplayed .\nDeaths , though each one is a tragedy , remain at levels far below the totals they reached at the peak of the first crisis in March and April .\nIn the week ending October 2 , Covid accounted for just 3.2 per cent of fatalities in British hospitals .\nCovid mortality levels are still drastically lower now than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 17 , 8,758 recorded deaths mentioned Covid as a possible factor on the death certificate .\nFor the first week in October , the comparable figure was just 321 .\nAs we also now know , many of the deaths in March and April followed a severe mishandling of the epidemic in care homes , and had little or nothing to do with the lack , or the existence , of lockdown measures .\nIn fact an examination of all the affected nations shows no obvious connection between the severity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered .\nThe key problem of the episode from the start \u2013 that the danger from the virus itself had been overstated \u2013 continues unabated .\nYet we are once again being accused of misbehaving by the simple action of living our lives .\nA blizzard of decrees compelled millions to wear face coverings , despite what the Government itself had once admitted was sketchy evidence for their benefits .\nNow a rise in cases , which is largely attributable to the normal increase in respiratory disease at this time of year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional shutdowns or for a so-called \u2018 circuit-breaker \u2019 .\nIn London , scanty evidence of a surge has been used by the utterly undistinguished Mayor , Sadiq Khan , to trigger misery and economic damage among the people whose interests he is supposed to protect .\nIt is this damage , combined with the shrivelling of much of the NHS , that makes this continuing foolishness especially hard to bear .\nIt may even be that more people die from postponed or missed treatments than from Covid .\nThe strangling of travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made life infinitely less enjoyable .\nIt has permanently killed countless brave small businesses and deprived huge numbers of men and women of their livelihoods .\nFairy Gold , summoned up from nowhere by Chancellor Rishi Sunak , may ease the initial pain .\nBut it must be paid for out of the nation \u2019 s life savings , and it will run out , leaving a bleak landscape of long-term unemployment and shrinking payments for those who suffer it .\nThe Prime Minister can be forgiven for taking what he , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent action back in March .\nWe knew so much less then than we do now .\nBut the time has now come to reconsider .\nThe practical effects of these measures on Covid are sketchy at best .\nTheir effects on human happiness , health , wellbeing and the economy are increasingly evident , deep , painful and lasting .\nEspecially since the Great Barrington Declaration , supported by several distinguished scientific experts of all political hues , including Britain \u2019 s own Sunetra Gupta , it is no longer possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one route out of this crisis .\nPowerful voices argue for a more nuanced and less painful way of learning to live with the virus , as we rebuild our prosperity and our freedom and look forward to a future free of lockdowns , circuit-breakers and family separation .\nBoris Johnson has the

to 10-14 days after the national election on Nov 3rd .\nIt relies on taking advantage of any presumed delays in determining the winner ( due to the deluge of postal votes ) in a group of key swing

\u201c The constitution is not suspended or transformed even in times of a pandemic\u2026 \u201d Needless to say , the Democratic Party was visibly disheveled by the court \u2019 s decision .\nDETROIT ( AP ) \u2014 Absentee ballots must arrive by Election Day to be counted , the Michigan Court of Appeals said Friday , blocking a 14-day extension that had been ordered by a lower court and embraced by key Democratic officials in a battleground state .\nAny changes must rest with the Legislature , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges said in a 3-0 opinion .\nAbsentee ballot extensions in Wisconsin and Indiana have also been overturned by higher courts .\nMichigan \u2019 s ability to handle a flood of ballots will be closely watched in a state that was narrowly won by President Donald Trump in 2016 .\nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson last week said 2.7 million people had requested absentee ballots , a result of a change in law that makes them available to any voter .\nMichigan law says absentee ballots must be turned in by 8 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens had ordered that any ballots postmarked by Nov. 2 could be counted if they arrived within two weeks after the Nov. 3 election .\nStephens said there was \u201c unrefuted evidence \u201d about mail delivery problems because of the coronavirus pandemic .\nShe said more than 6,400 ballots arrived too late to be counted in the August primary .\nThe appeals court , however , said the pandemic and any delivery woes \u201c are not attributable to the state.\n\u201d \u201c Although those factors may complicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not automatically amount to a loss of the right to vote absentee , \u201d the court said , noting that hundreds of special boxes have been set up across Michigan .\nThe court also reversed another portion of Stephens \u2019 decision , which would have allowed a non-family member to deliver a completed ballot in the final days before the election if a voter consented .\n\u201c The constitution is not suspended or transformed even in times of a pandemic , and judges do not somehow become authorized in a pandemic to rewrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the policymaking branches of

Election , together , with their media operatives , have made it central to their campaign message to brazenly lay at the feet of incumbent President Donald Trump the \u2018 over 200,000 COVID deaths \u2019 \u2013 a spurious claim , by any reasonable standard , that has gone virtually unchallenged by mainstream media and even many Republicans seeking to \u2018 distance \u2019 themselves from the President .\nIt \u2019 s as if the claim , which borders on insanity and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been generally accepted as the truth across wide swaths of the country .\nThe Democratic Party \u2019 s own platform says as much : As early as May of this year , Jeff Bezo \u2019 s Washington Post had already rendered its verdict in a \u2018 death counter \u2019 report with a matter-of-fact headline that read , \u201c Trump \u2019 s covid-19 inaction killed Americans .\nHere \u2019 s a counter that shows how many.\n\u201d IMAGE : It \u2019 s very much the \u2018 Trump virus \u2019 versus the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the notion of sending \u2018 tens of thousands \u2019 of Americans to their death is supposed to conjure up images of some kind of sick death march , it would be not far off from what Trump \u2019 s opponents are hoping to convey to voters in the 2020 election .\nIMAGE : New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has presided over one of the worst public health disasters in American history .\nIronically , just a day before the aforementioned WashPo \u2019 s journalistic murder conviction of Trump , it was none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post that published a scathing rebuke of NY Governor Andrew Cuomo \u2019 s disastrous and lethal nursing home policy \u2014 a policy that did in fact lead to thousands of dead elderly people in his state \u2019 s care .\nIn a recent episode of the

Biden will have their final debate on Thursday , to be broadcast from Nashville , Tennessee , with NBC News hosting and moderating the production that will include a new \u201c mute button \u201d feature .\nThe debate format will feature each candidate providing a two-minute opening statement on a range of topics , following by an open discussion on a range of topics selected by the moderator , NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker .\nThe debate topics selected are as follows , along with our brief commentary on what to watch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2013 Trump should be prepared for more unfounded claims that he \u2019 s killed people , and have a strong and coherent rebuttal ( which he \u2019 s yet to really provide ) .\nBiden will likely have to defend his national mask mandate idea again and how more lockdowns won \u2019 t further tank the economy .\n\u2022 \u201c American Families \u201d \u2013 The two candidates need to make their closing arguments on their economic agendas for the country .\nExpect for Trump to go hard on Biden \u2019 s tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more substantive than \u201c good paying jobs \u201d and would do well to address small business owners who \u2019 ve suffered greatly under their states \u2019 lockdown measures .\nTrump will bring up summer street mobs and protecting suburbs .\n\u2022 \u201c Race in America \u201d \u2013 Biden : \u2018 It \u2019 s about systemic racism\u2026 \u2019 Trump : \u2018 I do more for the African-American community\u2026 \u2019 but law and order will also be part of the conversation and it \u2019 s sure to get ugly .\nWatch out for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section of the debate .\n( More on this below . )\n\u2022 \u201c Climate Change \u201d \u2013 This topic has been included in every debate thus far and has received little post-debate attention .\nExpect to not learn anything new here .\nIt plays like a time filler .\nBut do look for Trump to pivot the conversation to fracking and energy policy , or at the very least troll Biden into talk about the Green New Deal .\n\u2022 \u201c National Security \u201d \u2013 This is Trump \u2019 s golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bigger picture of how Biden is a compromised and corrupt candidate on the international stage .\nIf Trump really wants to go for the jugular , he might paraphrase his former advisor Steve Bannon who recently said in a recent interview that Biden \u2018 couldn \u2019 t get a security clearance \u2019 as a sitting president .\nIf he does , this is a potential debate knockout punch .\nSadly , there won \u2019 t be any talk of ending foreign wars by either side , but we hope we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2013 Biden will do as he always has and attempt to stand on the shoulders of his former boss , President Barack Obama .\nLook for Trump to go on the attack lumping Biden into Obama \u2019 s failed policies \u2013 an attack line used successfully against Hillary Clinton in 2016 .\nWith Obama now stumping hard for Joe in battleground states , this has likely ignited Trump \u2019 s fuse on this topic once again .\n\u2022 Wildcard Topic \u2013 Every debate has at least one , and don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court will not get injected into this debate somehow by Trump .\nAnd once again , Biden will be forced to admit he \u2019 s not going to provide answer just yet .\nBiden \u2019 s so-called \u2018 Progressive \u2019 supporters will be listening attentively .\nThe new twist for this debate will be the introduction of a mute button that will be deployed during the opening statements by each candidate on the debate topics .\nThe aim is to have Trump and Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other candidate provides their initial answer on the topic question .\nDespite all the pumped up hype over the new mute button for the final debate format \u2014 that it will somehow leave Trump hamstrung and remove his \u201c go-to debate move \u201d of interrupting ( CNN actually reported that ) \u2014 in reality it can potentially hurt Trump and help Biden but for completely other reasons on Thursday \u2019 s debate stage .\nSince this will be a new feature introduced into the live production , you can bet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or misused by either the moderator , Welker , or the producers at NBC News .\nIt \u2019 s still not clear exactly how the feature will be deployed and who will have access to it throughout the debate .\nThat appears to be by design .\nFor these reasons , we do predict there will likely be at least one instance of the mute button being pushed during one of the candidate \u2019 s so-called \u2018 uninterrupted \u2019 time or even during their \u2018 open \u2019 rebuttals .\nLook for Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 during one of his rants , possibly while accusing Biden of corruption with Ukraine and/or China if the network deems it to be unacceptable and decides to dump it .\nDuring Biden \u2019 s speaking time , look for a \u2018 gliche \u2019 in the system that occurs when Joe loses his train of thought and begins to drift into a nonsensical tangent that would reflect badly on him in front of a live , national audience .\nIt \u2019 s all a stage managed event , in the end \u2014 not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new mute button is just another level of control .\nWatch carefully and don \u2019 t be fooled .\nIf it happens\u2026it \u2019 s a feature , not a bug .\nSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

have rounded on him , if the President loses in November .\nWhy him ?\n\u201c I \u2019 m a healthcare policy person \u2014 I have a background in medical science , but my role really is to translate medial science into public policy .\nThat \u2019 s very different from being an epidemiologist or a virologist with a single , limited view on things.\n\u201d On Dr Fauci \u201c He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task

herd immunity strategy \u2019 is survival of the fittest , let the infection spread through the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s never been the policy that I have advised .\nIt \u2019 s never even

many times\u2026 and yet it persists like so many other things , hence the term that the President is fond of using called fake news.\n\u201d On herd immunity Population immunity is a biological phenomenon that occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you \u2019 re building something in your basement : it \u2019 s down on the ground because gravity puts it there .\nIt \u2019 s not a \u2018 strategy \u2019 to say that herd immunity exists \u2014 it is obtained when a certain percentage of the population becomes resistant or immune to an infection , whether that is by getting infected or getting a vaccine or by a combination of both .\nIn fact , if you don \u2019 t that believe herd immunity exists as a way to block the pathways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you would never advocate or believe in giving widespread vaccination \u2014 that \u2019 s the whole point of it\u2026 I \u2019 ve explained it to people who seemingly didn \u2019 t understand it ; I \u2019 ve mentioned this radioactive word called herd immunity .\nBut that \u2019 s not a strategy that anyone is pursuing .\nWhat is his policy ?\n\u201c My advice is exactly this .\nIt \u2019 s a three-pronged strategy .\nNumber one : aggressive protection of high risk individuals and the vulnerable ( typically the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two : allocate resources so that we prevent hospital overcrowding , so that people can be treated for this virus and get the other serious medical care that is needed .\nNumber three : open schools , society and businesses because keeping them closed is enormously harmful \u2014 in fact it

.\nThe UK government continues to careen out of control in dishing out what is becoming an increasingly opaque and authoritarian public health policy , supposedly to \u2018 eliminate coronavirus.\n\u2019 Today we learned that PM Boris Johnson is now claiming that he felt \u2018 bounced into second lockdown by dodgy data , \u2019 presumably from the government \u2019 s secretive scientific committee known as SAGE .\nAccording to reports , Johnson felt that he was somehow \u2018 pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of misleading data from SAGE .\nIt \u2019 s become noticeable in recent months how UK government \u2019 s lauded science advisors have been trotting out ever-more outlandish predictions of death and doom , including one crazed projection of 4,000 daily deaths from COVID-19 should the government not impose more draconian measures .\nThe government appears to be in damage control now , with leaks to press designed to make Johnson look like the victim of \u2018 bad information \u2019 from his corporatist science cabal .\n\u201c I think he is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2026 .\nHe was really , really cross about the leak because at that point a different decision might still have been made , \u201d remarked one Cabinet Minister to the Daily Mail .\nThe source added , \u201c There is also concern that some of the information used to inform the decision now seems to be crumbling \u2026 .\nIn fact the figures seem to be suggesting things were getting better before the lockdown began \u2013 we are being shut down for a month when we did not need to be.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws into question what the government \u2019 s true long-term strategy is .\nThus far , the only tangible result of lockdown has been a complete destruction of the British economy , spiraling public and private debt , and massive collateral damage in public health due to the conversion of the country \u2019 s NHS into what is effectively becoming a \u2018 COVID only \u2019 health service \u2013 resulting in a growing number of lockdown deaths .\nMeanwhile , the police have threaten heavier \u2018 crack downs \u2019 on alleged lockdown offenders \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an already damaged relationship between law enforcement and the general public .\nIs the UK government really going to try and lockdown the population until May ?\nIf so , on what scientific basis are they taking such harsh totalitarian measures ?\nThe fear , of course , comes from what officials think will happen next .\nWe \u2019 re told that the Prime Minister fears a second wave larger than the first , but we \u2019 re not really told why .\nDecisions are made to tighten restrictions on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shared with the public .\nPerhaps the biggest question is how long this new phase will last .\nIf we \u2019 re hunkering down in fear of what happens if we don \u2019 t , when might it all end ?\nAnd have we already settled down to a very long winter ?\nMany of the answers lie with the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies , its name perhaps chosen so it could produce the acronym Sage .\nIt is fed by modellers , called SPI-M , who produce what \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario , or RWC .\nIn the UK system , government plans around this worst-case basis .\nBut if the country ends up being run around this scenario , then we enter problems .\nThere is little scrutiny of the Sage assumptions , because so many of them are unpublished .\nSome of its papers are released sporadically .\nBut some of its major planning is kept secret even from senior members of the government .\nThe secrecy is odd .\nIn classic pandemic theory , governments are supposed to keep the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and don \u2019 t know .\nThe risk is that a lack of transparency erodes confidence in ministers , and creates space for misinformation .\nThe other risk is that if government is relying on modelling , much depends on the accuracy of the modelling .\nIf it \u2019 s not scrutinised , mistakes are more likely to go uncorrected .\nMore fundamentally , if people are being deprived of their liberty , they deserve to know why .\nThat \u2019 s why The Spectator is publishing a document which the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of : the \u2018 reasonable worst-case scenario \u2019 for this coming winter .\nThe document is on our website and makes for grim reading : 85,000 dead from a new Covid wave , about a third more than have died so far .\nIt envisages 356,000 heading for hospital .\nDeaths are expected to peak at a lower rate than the first wave \u2014 but what is very different , this time , is the duration .\nThe second wave is expected to get steadily worse until March .\nThe Sage document starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a hypothesis , not a prediction .\nThe clue is in the name : a \u2018 worst-case planning scenario \u2019 is not the most likely outcome .\nBut as it says , under the UK system , this is the basis on which plans are being made .\nThe document , published on 30 July , explains why lockdown measures were never properly relaxed .\nIt also explains why ministers are so worried .\nIf its forecasts are even half-right , we \u2019 re not remotely close to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a near-exhausted enemy , the Brits see a monster ready to strike even harder as soon as normal life resumes .\nWhich is why there \u2019 s no rush to resume normal life .\nThe core Sage assumption is of \u2018 a difficult autumn followed by a large winter peak \u2019 , with the virus doubling every two weeks .\nAfter a month of this , restrictions would be tightened \u2018 to reduce non-household contacts to half of their normal pre-March 2020 lockdown levels \u2019 but schools would remain open .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pretty much the story to date .\nWhich makes the next assumption in the Sage plan significant : \u2018 These measures are sustained until the end of March 2021.\n\u2019 This is a plan to keep the restrictions until April .\nPerhaps longer\u2026 Continue this story at The Spectator SUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

Many as COVID Itself", "content": "Few public health officials dare ask the question : has our reaction to the \u2018 pandemic \u2019 turned into an unrivaled self-inflicted national disaster ?\nNew data from America \u2019 s Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) seems to suggest that it has .\nThe story is the name across the Atlantic .\nIn the UK , the government \u2019 s own Office for National Statistics has revealed how thousands of new excess deaths have likely occurred in nursing home settings , due to sick patients having been discharged there from hospitals \u2013 the very same policy which drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states like New York .\nHowever , these incidents are only the tip of a much larger iceberg .\nFor obvious reasons , both government and mainstream media are hesitant to speak about the elephant in the room : lockdown deaths .\nIn fact , the mere mention of this is met with a wall of obfuscation and official denials .\nAnd the numbers are not trivial either , which is why politicians , their lauded science advisors , public health gurus and their media mavens \u2013 all of whom were pushing hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject arises .\nThree-hundred-fifty years ago , John Graunt attempted to give Londoners an accurate assessment of fatality rates of diseases in the community so people could understand their risk level .\nUntil COVID-19 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) fulfilled the same role .\nThen the CDC abandoned tradition and sensibility and treated COVID differently than every other disease .\nFor a death to be considered a COVID death , COVID no longer needed to be the immediate or underlying cause of death .\nNow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if COVID was only a contributing condition .\nFor example , a certificate that lists dementia as the cause of death but doesn \u2019 t list a respiratory ailment is likely to be a case of dying with COVID , not from COVID .\nLikewise for accidents , heart attacks , strokes , and any other non-respiratory condition .\nSingapore , for example , only counts deaths as COVID deaths if they are accompanied by pneumonia .\nIf the United States followed this criterion , COVID deaths would total about 90,000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season .\nTo disentangle respiratory COVID deaths from other types of COVID deaths requires examining individual death records , which are difficult to obtain .\nFortunately , in May , Florida released data on 1,489 COVID deaths .\nAbout two-thirds of those deaths that listed more than just COVID as a cause also listed a respiratory condition .\nApplying this two-thirds estimate to the current official tally of 240,000 U.S. COVID deaths yields a very rough estimate of 160,000 deaths from COVID .\nRemarkably , this number represents about half of the approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced this year , according to the CDC \u2019 s latest estimate dated Oct. 3 .\nThe 300,000 number is determined by subtracting the 2,240,000 fatalities the CDC estimates we would expect to have seen from January to October if 2020 were a typical year from the 2,540,000 deaths we have actually suffered .\nThis begs the question : What is causing the remaining 140,000 excess deaths ?\nAlthough CDC records are far from comprehensive , they do provide some explanation : So far in 2020 , the CDC data shows there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths and 12,000 excess diabetes deaths .\nThe Alzheimer \u2019 s deaths are particularly heart-wrenching , as these represent people literally dying from loneliness and lack of human interaction .\nThe excess diabetes deaths could be due to the interruption of normal health-care operations .\nThere are many other documented and postulated sources of excess deaths , including delayed emergency room visits due to fear of COVID resulting in postponed or skipped treatment for heart attacks , strokes , cancer , and other ailments .\nDeaths of despair , such as suicides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also increased significantly .\nAdditionally , the CDC recently reported an unprecedented 26.5 percent surge in deaths for adults aged 25\u201344 , a group for which COVID is no worse than the flu .\nIn addition , as the 13,000 medical expert authors and signers of the Great Barrington Declaration point out , the deaths and diseases the lockdowns are creating will continue for years\u2026 Continue this story at

when Gates committed $ 10 billion to the WHO , he said \u201c We must make this the decade of vaccines.\n\u201d A month later , Gates said in a TED Talk that new vaccines \u201c could reduce

their states , studies and data continue to emerge clearly showing that prolonged use of face masks actually increases the risk of catching a respiratory illness .\nThe power of propaganda and social conditioning is becoming more obvious with each passing week , as actual hospitalizations and deaths attributed to COVID-19 fall to normal five year averages , and yet , government and their media partners continue inundating the public with sensational reporting and messaging suggesting countries like the US and UK are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , people should be wearing a mask at all times .\nThis very disconnect between public perception and reality was illustrated succinctly by Shane Neilson in his 2017 medical paper : \u201c When I walk past my waiting room , I see people wearing surgical masks .\nThis scene becomes surreal when my patients are watching pandemic disaster movies on the wall-mounted television screen , movies that feature frightened crowds who wear similar masks in the vain hope of protection .\nAs my eyes move from mask-wearing patients to screaming on-screen characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening here ?\n\u201d When will western media consumers finally realize that this protracted \u2018 public health \u2019 crisis has been wildly overblown ?\nThe recent rise in COVID-19 cases in Maine could be linked to the prolonged use of face masks by the general public .\nScientific data collected in randomized controlled trials over the past sixty years has shown consistently that the use of face masks to stop respiratory viruses is not only ineffective , but face masks may actually cause an increase in respiratory illnesses such as influenza and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet \u201c Big Sister \u201d Mills has been mandating face masks among the public since early Spring ostensibly to stop the spread of COVID-19 .\nHowever , in light of the voluminous amounts of data that were already available at the time , the move by Big Sister seems to be one based more on psychology and brainwashing than on actual , objective , empirical scientific data .\nThe U.S. CDC reported a meta-analysis of 10 face mask studies in the February , 2020 edition of its medical Journal , Emerging Infectious Diseases1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses .\nOne of the key studies cited in that CDC report was of 1607 hospital workers in Vietnam , published in the journal BMJ Open on April 22 , 2015.2 The study concluded that the use of surgical masks to control viral spread ( which they are not designed to do , anyway ) was negligible and that the prolonged use of the iconic cloth masks , so popular in today \u2019 s society , actually increased the cases of respiratory illness significantly .\nFurthermore , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC \u2019 s COVID-19 Response Team and published in the CDC \u2019 s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report3 showed that there is a 20 times greater chance of catching COVID-19 with prolonged wearing of a face mask when compared to those who never wore a face mask .\nIn that CDC study , it was found that of the 154 new cases of COVID-19 , where patients had both a positive PCR test for the purported virus \u2019 RNA particle and real symptoms , around 85 % reported they wore a face mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen days prior to symptom onset .\nThe control group in that study also showed symptoms of some sort of respiratory illness , but had a negative COVID-19 PCR test .\nIn that control group , 88 % of the people reported often or always wearing a face mask .\nAround 4 % of both groups reported never wearing a face mask prior to symptom onset .\nThis data continues to be ignored by Big Sister Mills and an establishment corporate media who simply refuses to report these facts on face masks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that turns people into fearful slaves of the governor , rather than empowered masters of their own lives via a strong , healthy and functional immune system .\nDr. Jay Bhattacharya , M.D.\n, professor at Stanford University Medical School , physician , epidemiologist , health economist and public health policy expert focusing on infectious diseases and vulnerable populations , said he thinks face masks should not be mandated .\n\u201c Masks have a use in certain settings where people use them properly .\nSo , for instance , in hospital settings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in very , very close contact with people that are vulnerable , \u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya .\n\u201c Mask mandates , like I \u2019 ve heard some politicians propose , are not supported by the scientific data .\nFor instance , there is no randomized evidence to suggest mask mandates would work to slow the spread of the disease .\nIn fact , for influenza the randomized studies that have been done suggest that they don \u2019 t work to slow the spread of the disease.\n\u201d To be clear , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use when used properly .\n\u201c As I said , they have appropriate uses in appropriate places .\nWe should take seriously what the scientific evidence is saying and not adopt policies that are far beyond what the scientific evidence has said.\n\u201d Most people today aren \u2019 t even using face masks correctly .\nFace masks must be changed out after every hour of use to prevent bacterial growth from building up and being re-breathed .\nNearly all people in society wear a mask into a business , then when they leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin , stuff it in their purse or pocket , or throw it on the dashboard of their car .\nAt the next stop , they take that dirty , contaminated mask , put it on and begin breathing through it , thinking they are \u201c stopping the spread \u201d of a virus , unaware of how their handling of the mask has made it more likely they \u2019 ll catch a respiratory illness than if they had worn no mask at all .\nDr. Bhattacharya is also disturbed at the collateral damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face masks when there is no scientific evidence to support that position .\n\u201c I think there are also enormous social harms caused by these mask mandates .\nMasks have become a political issue , a partisan issue ; you wear a mask if you are a Democrat , you don \u2019 t wear a mask if you are a Republican and you look on your fellow citizens and say well , you \u2019 re being irresponsible or you don \u2019 t care about freedom .\nI think public health should unite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have become an issue , especially these mandates .\nWhen it turns into a political issue like this we have to think , as public health workers , very carefully whether we \u2019 ve actually done the right thing .\nI think we \u2019 ve done a very , very poor job with the messaging , taking the science seriously , and we \u2019 ve created a disunity in the populace around masks \u2013 the distrust for one another that public health is not supposed to create.\n\u201d In addition to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the University of Minnesota \u2019 s Centers for Infectious Disease Research and Prevention ( CIDRAP ) also posted a commentary4 co-authored by Dr. Lisa Brosseau ScD , a national expert on respiratory protection and infectious diseases and professor ( retired ) at the University of Illinois , Chicago ( UIC ) and Dr. Margaret Sietsema , Ph D , an expert on respiratory protection and an assistant professor at UIC .\nThey noted , \u201c Sweeping mask recommendations \u2013 as many have proposed \u2013 will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission , as evidenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hubei province , China before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year .\nOur review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission , whether worn as source control or PPE\u2026\u2026we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission\u2026 \u201d The next screen shot is an addendum added by

Nagorno-Karabakh", "content": "In the final decade of the previous century , when the world was going through the \u201c end of history , \u201d according to some , the Southern Caucasus saw the outbreak of war .\n.\n.\na war that did not really come to an effective end or resolution .\nThe former Soviet states of Armenia and Azerbaijan were fighting each other over an area known as Nagorno-Karabakh , and \u201c [ m ] ore than 600,000 Azeris have not been able to return to their homes since the ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994 .\n.\n.\n[ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had to flee ] their homes during the war .\n.\n.\n[ while ] 30,000 people [ perished ] , \u201d reports the BBC .\nAnd , on 10 December 2006 the remaining people of Nagorno-Karabakh voted in a referendum , in which close to 75,000 people , or 83 % of voters , approved the entity \u2019 s first constitution .\nA document that calls their region a \u201c sovereign democratic \u201d state .\n.\n.\nThe International Crisis Group \u2018 s Sabine Freizer says that the \u201c date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significant : the poll took place fifteen years to the day after the mountainous Caucasian enclave \u2019 s Armenian population voted overwhelmingly for independence.\n\u201d The Republic of Azerbaijan never recognized this one-sided declaration of independence of this additional Armenian statelet in the region .\nWhen the conflict started , the Republic of Turkey which neighbours Armenia , was still a parliamentary democracy , in some ways continuing the work of the nation \u2019 s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk ( 1880-1938 ) and his followers known as Kemalists .\nThe dictum \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated Turkish foreign policy .\nSince 2002 , and the advent of the Justice and Development Party ( or AKP ) Turkey has been undergoing many changes , changes that have moved the country away from its founding father and his legacy .\nTurkey had never been directly involved in the fighting in the Southern Caucasus .\nBut now , more than a quarter of a century later , the Ankara government , led by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( aka the Prez ) and his AKP , has clearly changed its stance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflagration melting the previously \u2018 frozen conflict.\n\u2019 Some time ago , the Turkish author of Armenian descent Hovsep Hayreni suggested that the Prez \u2019 s timing for intervening in the recent Azeri-Armenian conflict centred on Nagorno-Karabakh ( \u2018 Mountainous Karabakh , \u2019 with the latter meaning Black Garden ) was highly significant .\nHayreni namely argued that the military moves , not coincidentally , started on the centenary of the outset of the Kemalists \u2019 campaign to recover the city of Kars occupied by the short-lived Republic of Armenia ( 1918-20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ankara government \u2019 s Eastern Front Army namely commenced its operations .\nAnd a hundred years later ( minus one day ) , on \u201c Sunday , September 27 , [ 2020 , ] the long-simmering conflict in the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region flared up , leaving hundreds dead and wounded , and sparking fears of broader regional hostilities.\n\u201d And , it seems fairly certain that the Azerbaijani government acted only upon tacit instructions given by Turkey \u2019 s strongman Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 after all , as the historian Dr Krista Goff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ] here was no immediate trigger in this instance.\n\u201d Yet , President Ilham Aliyev commenced these latest military operations to \u2018 liberate \u2019 the area known as Artsakh ( or the Republic of Artsakh ) by Armenians \u2013 in \u201c July [ 2020 ] Baku tested new weapons from Turkey , including TB2 drones that are effective in mountainous terrain [ and last ] August , Turkey and Azerbaijan [ even ] held joint military exercises , \u201d as explained by Dr Audrey Altstadt .\nThis basically means that Ankara did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act accordingly by the above-mentioned significant date on the calendar .\nAnd if has to be said that AKP-led Ankara is indeed very keen to observe symbolic dates and exploit their significance \u2013 for instance , the electoral victory that gave Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his AKP henchmen a veritable \u2018 Mandate for a Post-Kemalist Century \u2019 was held on 1 November 2015 , on the day that the Kemalist Ankara government had abolished the Ottoman Sultanate in 1922 .\nOr , another poignant example is the recent re-conversion of the Ayasofya ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The museum became a mosque once more on the day that , in 1922 , the signature of the Treaty of Lausanne had ushered in the way to the foundation of the Republic of Turkey the following year : July , 24th .\nFollowing this apparently joint Turco-Azeri decision to \u201c re-ignite a decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan .\n.\n.\nthe [ fighting ] had escalated beyond the \u2018 line of contact \u2019 dividing Armenian and Azerbaijani forces [ within a week ] .\nStepanakert , capital of the unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Amnesty International condemning the use of cluster munitions .\nArmenia has struck targets in Azerbaijan beyond the contested Karabakh region and civilians as well as soldiers have lost their lives in the most prolonged violence since the 1994 ceasefire .\nThese events differ from previous flare-ups , not only in intensity , but in the direct Turkish support for Azerbaijan , including the country \u2019 s widely reported recruitment of mercenaries from Syria , \u201d as explained by the historian Dr Jo Laycock .\nA hundred years ago , the Kemalist troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front , K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir ( 1882-1948 ) , capitalizing on the stipulations of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk \u2013 signed by the Bolshevik government of Russia and the Central Powers , including the Ottomans , on 3 March 1918 , which had secured Ardahan , Kars , and Batumi for the latter \u2013 tried to push through and conquer the whole of Eastern Armenia , as explained by Hayreni .\nFor in the spring of the previous year , the newly independent Republic of Armenia had annexed \u201c the region of Kars , Nakhichivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Nagorno-Karabakh ] \u201d as well , as related by Dr Ashot Aghasi Melkonyan .\nHovsep Hayreni thus reasons that in 1920 the Kemalists \u2019 aim had been to unite Anatolia with \u201c Azerbaijan \u201d in order to create a Turkish homeland stretching from the Aegean to the Caspian Seas .\nAs if the Kemalists wanted to revive Unionist plans of achieving a \u201c territorial continuity , \u201d as worded by the eminent specialist on all things to do with Pan-Turkism Professor Emeritus Jacob Landau , between Anatolian and Azeri Turks .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Red Army \u2019 s intervention thwarted this supposed design .\nAnd the Soviets created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region ( as an extraneous part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic ) in order to pacify the region and keep Armenians from fighting Azerbaijanis .\nThe region had been part of the Safavid realm from the 16th century onward as a so-called beglarbekt .\nThe end of Safavid rule in 1722 led to a short Ottoman occupation under Sultan Ahmed III ( 1703-30 ) .\nAccording to the historian Dr Ercan Karako\u00e7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the East was aimed at annexing Azerbaijan entirely.\n\u201d Still , the subsequent death of the initial-saviour-and-ultimate-destroyer of the Safavids , Nadir Shah ( 1688-1747 ) , led to the formation of an independent yet short-lived Karabakh Khanate , established by a certain \u201c Panah Ali-khan \u201d ( ca 1693-1759 ) , a descendant of the 17th-century figure Ibrahim-sultan Budagh-sultan ogly Javanshir .\nThe Khanate also included the mountain districts of Karabakh which were populated by Christians ( or Armenians , if you will ) .\nDr Karako\u00e7 gives he following physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region : The short-lived interlude of direct Azeri rule in Karabakh was followed by a consequential and long-lasting Russian intervention that took place in the context of the Russo-Persian war of 1804-1813 : Tsar Alexander I ( 1801-25 ) \u2019 s armed contest with the Qajar Fath Ali Shah ( 1797-1834 ) led to the Russian annexation of large swathes of the Northern Caucasus as well as considerable territories in the Southern Caucasus , solidified in the Treaty of Gulistan ( 24 October 1813 ) .\nBut long before this agreement , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of the 11-article Treaty of Kurekchay ( 14 May 1805 ) , signed between \u2018 Ibrahim Khan of Shusha and Qarabagh and the General of Infantry of All Russia \u2019 s Troops , Caucasian Inspection on Infantry and others , Prince Pavel Tsitsianov.\n\u2019 A document that secured the \u2018 granting [ of ] everlasting citizenship of All-Russian Empire to Ibrahim Khan of Shusha and Qarabagh with all family , posterity and possessions of his.\n\u2019 The treaty \u2019 s third article makes plain that the territory shall remain in Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange document probably has to be understood within the framework of Russo-Persian rivalry , yet seems to show quite plainly that the area of Karabakh was effectively in Azerbaijani hands in political terms .\nIn 1920 , the Soviets provided a socialist sauce to cover up the taste of Imperial Russia \u2019 s lasting legacy in the Southern Caucasus , thereby transforming the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh into a sticky Soviet inheritance to trouble lasting peace in the Southern Caucasus .\nThe Republic of Azerbaijan clearly utilises this historical precedent to develop its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part and parcel of the territorial body of the Caspian republic .\nIn much the same as Baku accepts Nakhchivan , which is surrounded by Armenia , and also borders Turkey and Iran , as an integral albeit territorially extraneous part of its broader jurisdiction \u2013 in 1991 , \u201c Nakhchivan declared itself an autonomous region of Azerbaijan governed by a democratically elected legislature.\n\u201d And although about \u201c 99 % of [ its ] population consists of Azerbaijanis ; \u201d there are \u201c some Armenian political groups [ that ] claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to Armenia , as huge Armenian religious and cultural remnants are witness of the historic presence of Armenians in the region.\n\u201d But , at the moment , this issue is non-extant as the \u2018 frozen conflict \u2019 surrounding Nagorno- Karabakh has once again flared up and is now claiming many innocent lives .\nIn contrast to these Azerbaijani claims to historical precedent and precedence , \u201c Armenian sources claim that Karabakh was part of a great Armenian kingdom as far back as the fourth century \u201d BCE , as related by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Boston-based Armenian scholar Dr Gayane Novikova , insightfully declares that \u201c Armenians and Azerbaijanis [ alike ] consider the territory of Nagorno Karabakh as their historical land and view the opponents as \u2018 newcomers \u2019 .\n\u201d By the time of Russian domination , though , the ethno-religious composition had clearly taken a definite shape , as in \u201c 1845 .\n.\n.\nAzerbaijanis .\n.\n.\nwere twice as numerous as Armenians \u201d in the area , as asserted by the Russian specialist Dr Anatoly Yamskov .\nFollowing the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( NKAO ) , where the \u201c idea of the \u2018 friendship between peoples , \u2019 which had been imposed and cultivated over the 70 years of Soviet rule , had been effective.\n\u201d Still , Dr Gayane Novikova , on the other hand , maintains that , in Soviet times ( 1922-91 ) , the \u201c Armenian minority \u201d made up \u201c 75 % -90 % of the NKAO \u2019 s entire population.\n\u201d In spite of her earlier-quoted positive words , Dr Novikova asserts that the seeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots in the Southern Caucasus : Novikova maintains that the leadership of the NKAO pursued a \u201c type of nationalistic policy \u201d that intensified the \u201c ethnic enmity \u201d on the part of the Armenian \u2018 minority \u2019 \u2013 and as pointed out by Dr Laycock , historically the \u201c majority of [ the area \u2019 s ] population have been Armenians , but [ with ] deep geographical , cultural and economic connections with the lowlands of Azerbaijan.\n\u201d Gayane Novikova , for her part , continues that the Armenian inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of protests .\nThese protests were held in favour of unifying the Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast with the Armenian SSR .\nProposals to that end were brought to the attention of the USSR leadership in 1945 , 1965 , 1967 , and 1977 .\nBut it was only at the very end of the Soviet existence that Comrade Gorbachev ( 1985-91 ) \u2019 s policies of Glasnost ( and to a lesser extent Perestroika ) led to a growing Armenian assertiveness , an assertiveness that liberated the conflict from its latency into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to the situation in 1990 \u2019 s Yugoslavia , the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute is a \u201c distinctly modern conflict , with groundwork laid not in the ancient past , but during the creation of Soviet states in the South Caucasus , \u201d explains Laycock \u2013 she point to the \u201c decision in 1921 to incorporate the region into Soviet Azerbaijan rather than Soviet Armenia .\n.\n.\nas pivotal.\n\u201d Dr Cornell posits that \u201c [ s ] ince the beginning of 1988 , a conflict endures between the South Caucasian nations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nagorno Karabakh.\n\u201d In fact , Dr Yamskov suggests that the conflict actually already \u201c emerged at the end of 1987 , with the protests and mass meetings of the already well-organized Armenian movement in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\u201d The apparently always trustworthy BBC summarises as follows : in 1988 , \u201c Azerbaijani troops and Armenian secessionists began a bloody war which left the de facto independent state in the hands of ethnic Armenians when a truce was signed in 1994.\n\u201d Since then , this \u2018 frozen conflict \u2019 has seen numerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd Laycock rightly points out that \u201c [ n ] either side has had a monopoly on violence or victimhood .\nMemories of terrible atrocities \u2013 for Armenians the Sumgait pogroms and for Azerbaijanis the massacre of hundreds of civilians at Khojaly in 1992.\n\u201d As a result , both communities have become increasingly more and more isolated from one another and thus younger Armenians and Azerbaijanis \u201c lack the older generations \u2019 experience of sharing space , if not without tension , then without the descent into violence.\n\u201d The violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Armenian narratives now focusing on the name Artsakh to supply arguments for ancient precedence and present independence .\nThese stories and words hold that \u2018 Artsakh \u2019 became part of the Armenian Kingdom ruled by the Artaxiad dynasty at about 180 BCE and remained part of that cultural orbit until the 4th century CE .\nIn fact , but fifteen years ago , in 2005 , the city of Tigranakert , founded by Armenian Artaxiad king Tigran II the Great ( 95-55 BCE ) was discovered and subsequently , acheological excavations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Archeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia commenced .\nWhereas , Azerbaijani narratives , in turn , also deftly use the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to feed a growing \u201c national movement and national identity , \u201d in post-Soviet times as argued by Dr Ceylan Tokluo\u011flu .\nIn the context of the ongoing Azeri-Armenian conflict , it seems prudent to recall that the Armenians commonly seem to refer to the Azerbaijanis as \u201c Turks.\n\u201d In fact , Dr Novikova states that Soviet archival documents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms like Azeri or Azerbaijani either , instead the nouns \u2018 Turk \u2019 and \u2018 Muslim \u2019 were apparently employed to refer to the non-Christian \u2018 Socialist inhabitants \u2019 of the Southern Caucaus .\nAfter all , the population of Turkey regards Azeris as fellow-Turks and as the Prez oftentimes likes to repeat , Turkey and Azerbaijan are \u201c two states , one nation.\n\u201d Back in the 11th century , the Seljuks ( \u201c a group of nomadic Turkish warriors from central Asia \u201d ) migrated into western Asia , these Turkic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucasus and Anatolia .\nCommonly held beliefs refer to these tribes as \u201c Oghuz Turks \u201d ( spelt as O\u011fuz , in Turkish ) , as a sub-branch of the Turkic peoples originally inhabiting Central Asia or Turan ( name of a mythical Turkish homeland ) \u2013 in 1037 , the Seljuks entered Iran , in 1055 , they took Baghdad , and in 1071 , they entered Anatolia following the victory at Malazgirt ( Manzikert ) .\nWhereas the AKP-led New Turkey is fast becoming a Sunni Islamic state in all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasty is nominally still staunchly secular befitting a Soviet successor state .\nStill , ever since independence in 1991 , \u201c popular devotion to Islam [ has been ] on the rise within Azerbaijan \u201d and consequently , the son and heir of the the Soviet-era leader of Azerbaijan , Heydar Aliyev ( 1923-2003 ) , Ilham Aliyev has been cultivating his Islamic image , at home as well as abroad .\nFive years ago , for instance , he \u201c and his family \u201d made a much-publicized Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site undertaken any time of the year , in contrast to the \u1e24ajj , which has specific dates according to the Islamic lunar calendar ) .\nStill , in contrast to Anatolian Turkey , Turkic Azerbaijan is a land of believers in the Twelver Shi \u2019 ite branch of Islam , the traditional doctrinal arch-enemies of the Ottomans .\nA fact that shows Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to be either a ruthless political

or Unionist Enver Pasha [ 1881-1922 ] \u2019 s brother ) .\nAliyev \u2019 s letter spoke about the good relation between Azerbaijan and \u201c brotherly Turkey.\n\u201d And 11 days later , Ankara seems to have persuaded Baku to engage in open military action in response to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 July , thereby reviving all-out war in the Southern Caucasus \u2013 the first real conflagration since

\u201c Azerbaijan [ had even ] used WMD ( weapon of mass destruction ) : weapons spreading white phosphorus over Nagorno Karabakh [ that ] have set o [ ff ] fire forests adjacent to civilian settlements \u201d on 30 October 2020 .\nSergey Naryshkin , the Director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service , on the other hand .\nalleges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of terrorists in the combat zone [ in the Karabakh region ] , including from the Middle East , primarily from Syria \u201d ( 6 November 2020 , reported by the website Al-Masdar Al- \u2018 Arabi ) .\nNaryshkin next went as far as directly accusing \u201c Turkish intelligence \u201d or the National Intelligence Organization ( or M\u0130T , in accronymized Turkish ) , if you will .\nIn saying these words , Naryshkin actually directly accused the Turkish President of personally selecting Jihadi terrorists to fight against Armenian forces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Intelligence Organization ( or M\u0130T ) , founded in 1965 , and since the adoption of Law No .\n2937 ( 1983 ) , subordinated directly to the Prime Minister .\nUnder AKP tutelage , the M\u0130T \u2019 s powers have greatly increased , turning the nation into a veritable surveillance state and with the M\u0130T becoming \u201c \u200bTayyip \u2019 s Praetorian Guard , \u201d as coined by me in 2014 .\nEven though the Republic of Turkey is currently ruled by means of a presidential system ( the post of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Tayyip Erdo\u011fan himself now occupying the top spot , it would stand to reason that he still regards and uses Turkey \u2019 s National Intelligence Organization as his personal Praetorian Guard .\nThese Russian allegations are equally shared by the Armenians , who even assert that Turkish military personnel has joined Jihadi mercenaries hailing from Syria .\nThe Republic of Armenia ( Hayastan ) \u2019 s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has also made some remarkable statements in this context : \u201c Erdogan is arming Azerbaijanis because he wants another genocide .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight : we have evidence.\n\u201d While talking to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera , he went straight to the point \u201c we have propaganda videos of jihadists geolocated at the site of hostilities [ in Nagorno-Karabakh ] .\nThere are also dead bodies of some of them .\nThere is no doubt about that .\nAll evidence has already been published.\n\u201d With some hyperbole , the PM then declared the following : \u201c And the goal is clear : Turks want another genocide of the Armenian people.\n\u201d Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the issue of the timing of the military operations does point towards some kind premeditated agenda .\nBut rather than ascribing sheer genocidal intentions to the figure of Turkey \u2019 s current Islamist strongman , the goal arguably seems far from mysterious : on the one hand , the military adventure in the Caucasus is an excellent ploy to whip up nationalist sentiment at home , where economic woes and continuing severe financial crises have made the public at large more than just restless .\nThese crises seem in no small measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures in Syria and Libya , yet he seems to have imagined that another military adventure next door might just sway his naysayers .\nTayyip Erdo\u011fan seems to view the whole world through the prism of domestic policy .\nIn this instance , though , the matter of Turkic solidarity and Islamic brotherhood also may have possibly swayed him to intervene in the Southern Caucasus .\nUsing alarmist language , Pashinyan is craftily capitalizing on the West \u2019 s sympathetic instincts .\nThe West easily condemns Turkey for its continued refusal to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt the same time , the West equally easily sides with the Christian victims of Ottoman policy , more often than not , perceived as yet another example of Turkish barbarity .\nThough recently , the Prez acted in a way that perpetuates what I have termed the \u201c invented tradition of Turkish denialism.\n\u201d In the not too faraway past , though , the Islamist strongman had sung a very different tune : in 2014 , the year prior to the centenary of the \u201c Shameful Act , \u201d Erdo\u011fan \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] fell short of acknowledging the Armenian Genocide , but could be seen as a first move towards a more realistic form of coming to terms with the past or Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung.\n\u201d Alas , in the following year ( 2015 ) , \u201c the Turkish government once again pushed its denialist narrative in response to global centenary commemorations of the implementation of the Deportation Act ( Tehcir Kanunu ) , leading to wholesale genocidal consequences in weeks and months to come.\n\u201d The recent completion of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline ( or TAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong ties linking the Sunni New Turkey with Shi \u2019 a Azerbaijan .\nThese ties go way beyond mere abstract notions of racial or religious affinity , and instead display the sheer power money and its concomittant prestige and influence .\nThe TAP , \u201c designed to export energy from Azerbaijan \u2019 s offshore Shah Deniz field to Europe , \u201d is the icing on the Turco-Azeri cake of friendship .\nTurkey is famously a Middle-Eastern state without significant hydrocabon assets , while its \u2018 brotherly \u2019 neighbour of Azerbaijan is \u201c one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries and is a crucial oil and gas supplier in the Caspian Sea region.\n\u201d On the other hand , the AKP-led New Turkey has now for years been trying to transform itself into an energ hub .\nAs a result , Ankara has been cultivating good relations with oil-and-gas rich capitals like Moscow and Erbil , resulting in pipelines entering Turkey to transport its sticky wealth into the land and beyond .\nThe TAP \u201c is the final stage of Azerbaijan \u2019 s [ southern gas corridor or ] SGC , designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , Albania and Italy from the second-phase development of the BP-led 1.2 trillion m\u00b3 offshore Shakh Deniz field.\n\u201d These lucrative pipes seem to constitute the backbone of the Turco-Azeri relationship .\nThe independent provider of consultancy services relating to global petroleum , natural gas , and coal industries , Argus Media , has recently said that \u201c Azerbaijan has displaced Russia as the top gas supplier to Turkey for the first time this year.\n\u201d President Aliyev clearly regards the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh as vital to the political health of Azerbaijan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , he curtly declared that Armenia and its military forces \u201c need to leave our territory , and then , the war will stop and then the conflict will come to an end.\n\u201d It stands to reason that Tayyip Erdo\u011fan could not but encourage and support his \u2018 brother \u2019 on this issue , particularly , when taking account of the fact that the veins connecting both nations carry a liquid more valuable than blood , more valuable than blood for the survival of AKP-led Ankara .\nThe economic crises besetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country \u2019 s recently-adopted presidential system that has led to outright nepotism and blatant displays of incompetence .\nThe Prez \u2019 s heir apparent ( and son-in-law ) had been put in charge of the county

Instagram account : \u201c His resignation comes a day after the head of Turkey \u2019 s central bank was replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged the country \u2019 s economy into a crisis , with the lira tumbling 30 percent this year.\n\u201d In contrast , Azerbaijan \u201c has benefited from high oil prices and increased gas production , although its non-oil and gas sectors have also shown improvement .\nOther strengths include a strong sovereign fund , gas abundance in the Caspian Sea , an increase in exports to Turkey and Europe , serving as a geographic liaison between China and Europe , and a positive general business environment.\n\u201d Post-Script : All \u2019 s Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh realities , could Turkey really have acted in any other way .\n.\n.\nat the end of the day , money talks , and Armenia as a landlocked nation of about 3 milllion inhabitants may very well occupy the moral high ground in the arena of public opinion but the power of oil and gas will always prevail in the real world .\nAnd , more often than not , strongmen like Erdo\u011fan and Aliyev , will just get away with murder .\n.\n.\nAnd as if underlining this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Armenian PM took to social media , abandoning his alarmist rhetoric , to announce that a peace deal through Russian mediation had been achieved .\nA peace deal that seemed to feel like an Azeri victory : No abandoning his flair for hyperbole , Nikol Pashinyan spoke of an \u201c unspeakably painful agreement.\n\u201d His counterpart , President Ilham Aliyev , was in triumphant mood , indicating that the three signatures on the paper detailing \u201c the deal would \u201c return our territories without any further bloodshed.\n\u201d In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty of Kurekchay ( 1805 ) , Russia \u2019 s Vladimir Putin assured that Russian peacekeeping forces will be deployed along the contact line in Nagorno-Karabakh and within the corridor that connects the region with Armenia .\nNow that peace seems to have returned to the Southern Caucasus , Turkey and Azerbaijan can continue their \u2018 brotherly \u2019 relations in further efforts to thwart Russian progress and Armenian assertiveness , efforts that will take place under Putin \u2019 s benevolent tutelage in an ironic twist of fate .\n*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geo-political analyst who used to

of community transmission , and children are more likely to get the virus outside of school settings , \u201d UNICEF said .\nThe numbers : As of November , 572 million students \u2014 about 33 percent of all students \u2014 are being affected by 30 nationwide school closures , the report found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected almost 90 percent of students around the world .\nKids accounted for one in nine reported Covid-19 infections [ ie .\nPCR positive tests ] worldwide , the report found .\n\u201c While children can get sick and can spread the disease , this is just the tip of the pandemic iceberg , \u201d said Henrietta Fore , UNICEF executive director .\n\u201c Disruptions to key services and soaring poverty rates pose the biggest threat to children .\nThe longer the crisis persists , the deeper its impact on children \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe future of an entire generation is at risk.\n\u201d Dropoff in services : From surveys across 140 countries , UNICEF estimates that 70 percent of mental health services for children and adolescents have been disrupted during the pandemic , with 65 percent of countries reporting a decrease in home visits by social workers in September compared to last year .\nNearly one-third of the countries saw a drop of at least 10 percent in coverage for health services .\nThat includes routine vaccinations , outpatient care for childhood infectious diseases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been a 40 percent decline in the coverage of nutrition services for women and children .\nThe number of children hurt by multidimensional poverty \u2014 characterized by poor health , education and living standards , in addition to the traditional monetary standards \u2014 is estimated to have increased by 15 percent globally by mid-2020 .\nTransmission findings : Child-to-child transmission of the coronavirus in schools was \u201c uncommon and not the primary cause \u201d of infections among children who caught the virus while

Kennedy Jr: \u2018New COVID Vaccine Should Be Avoided At All Cost\u2019", "content": "I would like to draw your attention urgently to important issues related to the next Covid-19 vaccination .\nFor the first time in the history of vaccination , the so-called last generation mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material , which represents the genetic manipulation , something that was already forbidden and until then considered criminal .\nThis intervention can be compared to genetically manipulated food , which is also highly controversial .\nEven if the media and politicians currently trivialize the problem and even stupidly call for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normality , this vaccination is problematic in terms of health , morality and ethics , and also in terms of genetic damage that , unlike the damage caused by previous vaccines , will be irreversible and irreparable .\nDear patients , after an unprecedented mRNA vaccine , you will no longer be able to treat the vaccine symptoms in a complementary way .\nThey will have to live with the consequences , because they can no longer be cured simply by removing toxins from the human body , just as a person with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klinefelter syndrome , Turner syndrome , genetic cardiac arrest , hemophilia , cystic fibrosis , Rett syndrome , etc . )\n, because the genetic defect is forever !\nThis means clearly : if a vaccination symptom develops after an mRNA vaccination , neither I nor any other therapist can help you , because the damage caused by the vaccination will be genetically irreversible .\nIn my opinion , these new vaccines represent a crime against humanity that has never been committed in such a big way in history .\nAs Dr. Wolfgang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In fact , this \u201c promising vaccine \u201d for the vast majority of people should be FORBIDDEN , because it is genetic manipulation !\n\u201d The vaccine , developed and endorsed by Anthony Fauci and funded by Bill Gates , uses experimental mRNA technology .\nThree of the 15 human guinea pigs ( 20 % ) experienced a \u201c serious adverse event \u201d .\nNote : messenger RNA or mRNA is the ribonucleic acid that transfers the genetic code of the DNA of the cell nucleus to a ribosome in the cytoplasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines the order in which the amino acids of a protein bind and act as a mold or pattern for the synthesis of that protein .\nVaccine COVID = IRREVERSIBLE GENETIC DAMAGE \u2013 A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY .\nDOES CORONAVIRUS EXIST OR NOT ?\nYes , like many other viruses .\n2 .\nDOES IT HAVE A CURE ?\nYes , if you use the proper medicines and do not leave your health in the hands of corrupt and mercantile health systems .\nYes and many , some are acting discreetly giving appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many videos in the networks talking about these treatments , and many have been threatened , disqualified or silenced .\nYes , and there is a world union calling for more doctors and scientists called Doctors and Scientists for Truth , to expose the falsity of the treatment they have given to the bug issue .\nNo .\nThe WHO changed the term that referred to the pandemic , before the bug was launched in order to end the pandemic .\nYes , like all flu .\n7 .\nIF I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT I WILL DIE ?\nNo .\nIf you have symptoms , just take the appropriate medicine from the first day ( strengthen the immune system , take anti-inflammatory and anti-influenza ) and cure yourself at home .\n8 .\nCAN IT BE PREVENTED ?\nYes , being as clean as you should be , and maintaining a high immune system .\nAnd you also have : Ozone Therapy , Chlorine Dioxide with the preventive protocol .\n9 .\nARE THE COUNT OF INFECTED AND DEAD BY THE VIRUS CERTAIN ?\nNo .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ any data , would be in fact 10 % of that number , because the causes of deaths were other diseases , and the tests are not reliable , they give false positives .\nThe human being has many microorganisms and viruses in the body and this does not mean that you are a sick or infected person , or that you have the virus , however , the viruses that are supposedly \u201c so aggressive \u201d present some symptoms in the patients because the body releases alarms from an intruder ( fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and according to Koch \u2019 s theory the answer is NO .\nTo be the excuse to restrict freedoms , to change the current economic system to a more oppressive / enslaving , scary , blind flock obedience .\n14 .\nARE MANY COUNTRIES PART OF THIS MALICIOUS PLAN ?\n15 .\nWILL WE GET OUT OF THIS ?\nYes .\nAnd all those who contributed to the deaths and the plan will fall , and they will pay for what they did .\nNo .\nFear diminishes your immune system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS THE MEDIA PART OF THE PLAN ?\nYes .\nThe owners of the media are accomplices .\nThis is called mind control .\n18 .\nWHAT SHOULD I DO ?\nYou protect yourself , and if you get sick you already know how to heal yourself at home , or with your trusted doctor who will not commit to the abandonment protocol .\nNo .\nIf you get healthy , vaccines bring chemicals , heavy metals and a series of \u201c bugs \u201d that will only affect your health more in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentally .\nIt \u2019 s your body , and it \u2019 s your right to decide about it , and about your physical and mental health .\nWould you trust a vaccine after a virus has been created to exterminate humanity ?\nYes !\nAnd we will be victorious !\nWe need to stay together and wake other people up , giving

the Bundestag , enshrined into law , and presumably stamped with one of those intricate official stamps that German bureaucrats like to stamp things with .\nNow , this \u201c Infection Protection Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament , is not in any way comparable to the \u201c Enabling Act of 1933 , \u201d which formally granted the government the authority to issue whatever edicts it wanted under the

and anyone who suggests there is is \u201c a far-right AfD extremist , \u201d \u201c a neo-Nazi conspiracy theorist , \u201d or \u201c an anti-vax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Protection Act was being legitimized ( i.e.\n, the current one , not the one in 1933 ) , tens of thousands of anti-totalitarian protesters gathered in the streets , many of them carrying copies of the Grundgesetz ( i.e.\n, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany ) , which the parliament had just abrogated .\nThey were met by thousands of riot police , who declared the demonstration \u201c illegal \u201d (

\u201d that are threatening the public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g.\n, that the vast majority of those infected suffer only mild to moderate flu symptoms or , more commonly , no symptoms at all , and

attack by an apocalyptic plague .\nThey are posting scientific facts on the Internet .\nThey are staging these protests and otherwise challenging the government \u2019 s right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspend

evidence of a pandemic , merely the illusion of one .\nWe have suffered incalculable loss for no evident reason , other than the ambitions of unscrupulous despots who wish to transform the global

prosecuted in a court of law .\nIdentification of What Exactly ?\nThe World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( COronaVIrus Disease 2019 ) .\nThey declared a global COVID 19 pandemic on March 11th 2020 .\n\u201c The etiologic agent [ causation for the disease ] responsible for the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan has been identified as a novel betacoronavirus , ( in the same family as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV ) via next generation sequencing ( NGS ) from cultured virus or directly from samples received from several pneumonia patients.\n\u201d The WHO \u2019 s claim is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19 .\nThey also allege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers in Wuhan .\nIn the WHO \u2019 s Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCov Situation Report 1 , they state : \u201c The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus , which was isolated on 7 January 2020\u2026\u2026On 12 January 2020 , China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus for countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits.\n\u201d These two statements from the WHO clearly suggest the SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated ( meaning purified for study ) and then genetic sequences were identified from the isolated sample .\nFrom this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to test for the virus in towns , cities and communities around the world .\nAccording to the WHO and Chinese researchers , these tests will find the virus that causes COVID 19 .\nYet the WHO also state : \u201c Working directly from sequence information , the team developed a series of genetic amplification ( PCR ) assays used by laboratories.\n\u201d The Wuhan scientists developed their genetic amplification assays from \u201c sequence information \u201d because there was no isolated , purified sample of the so called SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nThey also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered virions ( the spiky protein ball containing the viral RNA . )\nHowever , such protein structures are not unique .\nThey look just like other round vesicles , such as endocytic vesicles and exosomes .\nVirologists claim that it is not possible to \u201c isolate \u201d a virus because they only replicate inside host cells .\nThey add that Koch \u2019 s postulates do not apply because they relate to bacteria ( which are living organisms ) .\nInstead , virologists observe the virus \u2019 cytopathogenic effects ( CPE ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell cultures .\nWhen Chinese researchers first sequenced the full SARS-CoV-2 genome they observed CPE in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells .\nVero E6 are an immortalised monkey cell line and Huh7 are immortalised cancer ( tumorigenic ) cells .\nMeaning they have been maintained in vitro ( in petri dish cultures ) for many years .\nCentral to the official SARS-CoV-2 story is the idea that it is a zoonotic virus , capable of bridging the species gap from animals to humans .\nWhen scientists from the U.S. CDC \u201c infected \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted the following : \u201c We examined the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in several common primate and human cell lines , including human adenocarcinoma cells ( A549 ) [ lung celles ] , human liver cells ( HUH7.0 ) , and human embryonic kidney cells ( HEK-293T ) , in addition to Vero E6 and Vero CCL81 [ monkey cells ] \u2026\u2026No cytopathic effect was observed in any of the cell lines except in Vero cells [ monkey cells ] \u2026\u2026.HUH7.0 and 293T cells showed only modest viral replication and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] were incompatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\u201d The CDC did not observe any CPE in human cells .\nThey saw no evidence that this alleged virus caused any human illness .\nNor did this supposed human virus show any notable replication in human cells , suggesting human to human infection would be impossible .\nNoting this problem , a team of Polish scientists introduced this sequenced \u201c virus \u201d to human epithethelium ( airway ) cells .\nThey observed the effects on these HAE cultures for 5 days .\nThey noted much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated : \u201c We did not observe any release of the virus from the basolateral side of the HAE culture.\n\u201d Meaning they did not see any evidence of the supposed virions breaching the cell wall membrane .\nAgain suggesting this so called virus isn \u2019 t infectious in human beings .\nIt is not clear that SARS-CoV-2 is a human virus capable of causing illness .\nIt may not even physically exist .\nIs it nothing more than a concept based upon predictive genetic sequences ?\nThe Wuhan Center for Disease Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical Centre published the first full SARS-CoV-2 genome ( MN908947.1 ) .\nThis has been updated many times .\nHowever , MN908947.1 was the first genetic sequence describing the alleged COVID 19 etiologic agent ( SARS-CoV-2 ) .\nAll subsequent claims , tests , treatments , statistics , vaccine development and resultant policies are based upon this sequence .\nIf the tests for this novel virus don \u2019 t identify anything capable of causing illness in human beings , the whole COVID 19 narrative is nothing but a charade .\nThe WUHAN researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence together by matching fragments found in samples with other , previously discovered , genetic sequences .\nFrom the gathered material they found an 87.1 % match with SARS coronavirus ( SARS-Cov ) .\nThey used de novo assembly and targeted PCR and found 29,891-base-pair which shared a 79.6 % sequence match to SARS-CoV .\nThey had to use de novo assembly because they had no priori knowledge of the correct sequence or order of those fragments .\nQuite simply , the WHO \u2019 s statement that Chinese researchers isolated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Wuhan team used 40 rounds of RT-qPCR amplification to match fragments of cDNA ( complimentary DNA constructed from sampled RNA fragments ) with the published SARS coronavirus genome ( SARS-CoV ) .\nUnfortunately it isn \u2019 t clear how accurate the original SARS-CoV genome is either .\nIn 2003 a team of researchers from from Hong Kong studied 50 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) .\nThey took samples from 2 of these patients and developed a culture in fetal monkey liver cells .\nThey created 30 clones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unable to find evidence of any other known virus , in just one of these cloned samples they found genetic sequences of \u201c unkown origin.\n\u201d Examining these unknown RNA sequences they found 57 % match to bovine coronavirus and murine hepatitis virus and deduced it was of the family Coronaviridae .\nConsidering these sequences to suggest a newly discovered SARS-CoV virus ( new discoveries being ambrosia for scientists ) , they designed RT-PCR primers to test for this novel virus .\nThe researchers stated : \u201c Primers for detecting the new virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human pneumonia-associated coronavirus genome in clinical samples .\nOf the 44 nasopharyngeal samples available from the 50 SARS patients , 22 had evidence of human pneumonia-associated coronavirus RNA.\n\u201d Half of the tested patients , who all had the same symptoms , tested positive for this new alleged virus .\nNo one knows why the other half tested negative for this novel SARS-CoV virus .\nThe question wasn \u2019 t asked .\nThis supposed virus had just a 57 % sequence match to allegedly known coronavirus .\nThe other 43 % was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recorded as a new genome as GenBank Accession No .\nAY274119 .\nThe Wuhan researchers subsequently found an 79.6 % sequence match to AY274119 and therefore called it a novel strain of SARS-CoV ( 2019-nCoV \u2013 eventually renamed SARS-CoV-2 ) .\nNo one , at any stage of this process , had produced any isolated , purified sample of any virus .\nAll they had were percentage sequence matches to other percentage sequence matches .\nScientists are very annoyed because they keep saying the virus has been isolated but no one believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , no one has provided a single purified sample of the SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nWhat we have instead is a completed genome and , as we are about to discover , it isn \u2019 t particularly convincing .\nInvestigative journalists Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter asked some of the scientists who said they had images of SARS-C0V-2 virions to confirm these were images of an isolated , purified , virus .\nNone of them could .\nIn Australia scientists from the Doherty Institute , announced that they had isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : \u201c We have short ( RNA ) sequences from the diagnostic test that can be used in the diagnostic tests \u201d This explains why the Australian government state : \u201c The reliability of COVID-19 tests is uncertain due to the limited evidence base\u2026There is limited evidence available to assess the accuracy and clinical utility of available COVID-19 tests.\n\u201d In The UK , in July , a group of concerned academics wrote a letter to the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in which they asked him to : \u201c Produce independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 virus has been isolated.\n\u201d To date they have not received a reply .\nSimilarly , UK researcher Andrew Johnson made a Freedom of Information Request to Public Health England ( PHE ) .\nHe asked them to provide him with their records describing the isolation of a SARS-COV-2 virus .\nTo which they responded : \u201c PHE can confirm it does not hold information in the way suggested by your request.\n\u201d Canadian researcher Christine Massey made a similar freedom of information request , asking the Canadian government the same .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Having completed a thorough search , we regret to inform you that we were unable to locate any records responsive to your request.\n\u201d In the U.S. the Centre For Disease Control ( CDC ) RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel state : \u201c \u2026No quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available\u2026\u2026..Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.\n\u201d Last updated on 13th July 2020 , the CDC are yet to obtain any pure viral sample from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 .\nThey openly admit their tests don \u2019 t necessarily show if SARS-CoV-2 is either present or causes COVID 19 .\nWe are told that none of this matters .\nThat we are ignorant and just don \u2019 t understand virology .\nTherefore , we must except pictures of things we know could be something else and genetic sequences ( which could be anything else ) as conclusive proof that this virus , and the disease it is supposed to cause , are real .\nThe WHO , and every government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government scientific advisor , supranational institutions and others who promote the official COVID 19 narrative , assert that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID 19 .\nWhile no one has ever produced a sample of this supposed virus , the alleged SARS-CoV-2 genome has been published .\nIt is in the public domain .\nKey genetic sequences , in the SARS-CoV-2 genome , are said to have specific functions .\nThese are the target proteins that scientists test for to identify the presence of the \u201c virus \u201d .\nThese include : \u2022 RNA-polymerase ( Rd-Rp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RNA to replicate inside the cytoplasm of COVID 19 diseased epithelial cells .\n\u2022 S gene ( Orf2 ) \u2013 this glycoprotein forms the spike on the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface which supposedly facilitates SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptors on cells , allowing the RNA inside the virion protein shell ( capsid ) to pass into the now infected cell .\n\u2022 N gene ( Orf9a ) \u2013 the nucleocapsid gene which binds the RNA in capsid formation The WHO maintain a publicly available record of the RT-PCR primers and probes used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific nucleotide sequences that bind ( anneal ) to the antisense and sense strands of the synthesised cDNA ( called forward and reverse primers respectively . )\nThe cDNA strands separate when heated and reform when cooled .\nPrior to cooling , nucleotide sequences called probes are introduced to anneal to specific target regions of the suspected viral genome .\nDuring amplification , as the regions between primers elongate , when a primer strikes a probe , the probe decays releasing a fluorescent or dye which can then be read by researchers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ which scientists claim to prove the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in a sample .\nSomething else which is publicly available is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ( BLAST ) .\nThis allows anyone to compare published nucleotide sequences with all those stored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) genetic database called GenBank .\nTherefore we can BLAST the claimed SARS-CoV-2 primers , probes and target gene sequences .\nThe WHO \u2019 s forward , reverse primers and probe protocols , for the alleged SARS-CoV-2 viral genome , are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E gene profiles .\nAnyone can run them through BLAST to see what we find .\nThe vital RdRP nucleotide sequence , used as a forward primer is \u2013 ATGAGCTTAGTCCTGTTG .\nIf we run a nucleotide BLAST this is recorded as a complete SARS-CoV-2 isolate with a 100 % matched sequence identity .\nSimilarly the reverse E gene primer sequence \u2013 ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA \u2013 reveals the presence of the Orf1ab sequence which also identifies SARS-CoV-2 .\nHowever , BLAST also enables us to search the nucleotide sequences of the microbial and human genomes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence it reveals 99 human chromosome with a 100 % sequence identity match .\nThe Orf1ab ( E gene ) returns 90 with a 100 % sequence identity match to human chromosomes .\nDoing the same for these sequences with a microbial search finds 92 microbes with a 100 % match to the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and 100 matched microbes , with a 100 % sequence identity , to the vital SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene .\nWhenever we check the so called unique genetic markers for SARS-CoV-2 , recorded in the WHO protocols , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with various fragments of the human genome .\nThis suggests that the genetic sequences , which are supposed to identify SARS-CoV-2 , are not unique .\nThey could be anything from microbial sequences to fragments of human chromosomes .\nSo called fact checkers , like Reuters \u2019 Health Feedback project , have been quick to dismiss the claims of those who have noticed the apparent lack of specificity in the supposed SARS-CoV-2 genome .\nUsing a slew of strawman arguments like , \u201c this claim suggests every test should be positive , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their debunking attempt runs something like this : Primers are designed to bind to specific nucleotide sequences that are unique to the virus .\nThe forward primer may bind to a particular chromosome but the reverse primer doesn \u2019 t bind to the same chromosome and so the chromosome is not present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nMoreover because the forward and perverse primers envelop the sequence to be amplified the cDMA sequence between primers is unique to the virus .\nThis seems to deliberately misrepresent the significance of these findings by forwarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the fact checkers themselves , are making .\nBLAST searches show that these target sequences are not unique to SARS-CoV-2 .\nNor do all targets need to be found for a result to be deemed positive .\nMoroccan researchers investigated the epidemiology of Moroccan alleged cases of SARS-CoV-2 .\nNine percent were positive for three genes , eighteen percent were positive for two genes and seventy three percent for just one .\nAs we have just discussed , many may have been positive for none .\nThis is entirely in keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state : Regardless of the spurious arguments of well funded fact checkers , if the forward and reverse primers identify junk , perhaps one being the fragment of a chromosome and the other a microbial sequence , then the amplified region between them is probably junk too .\nThe argument that RT-PCR only finds RNA is specious .\nNatural transcription ( the separation of DNA strands ) occurs during gene expression .\nNo one is saying whole chromosomes or microbes are sequenced in the alleged SARS-CoV-2 genome .\nThough they may , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alleged markers , used to test for this supposed virus , are not fit for purpose .\nRT-PCR tests do not sequence the entire genome .\nThey look for incidents of specific probe florescence to indicate the presence of sequences said to exist .\nThese sequences are defined by MN908947.1 and the subsequent updates .\nThese primers and probes could reveal nothing but RNA matches extracted from non-coding , sometimes called \u201c junk , \u201d DNA ( cDNA . )\nFor example the SARS-CoV-2 S gene is meant to be highly specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target sequence is \u2013 TTGGCAAAATTCAAGACTCACTTTC .\nA microbial BLAST search returns 97 microbial matches with 100 % identity sequence match .\nThe lowest identity percentage match , within the top 100 , is 95 % .\nA human genome BLAST also finds a 100 % sequence match to 86 human chromosome fragments .\nNo matter where you look in the supposed genome of SARS-CoV-2 , there is nothing in the WHO \u2019 s test protocols that clearly identifies what it is .\nThe whole genome could be false .\nThe tests do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reveal is a soup of unspecified genetic material .\nIf so , as there are no isolates or purified samples of the virus , without a viable test , there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 exists .\nTherefore , nor is there any evidence that a disease called COVID 19 exists .\nThis infers that there is no scientific basis for any claims about COVID 19 case numbers , hospital admissions or mortality figures .\nAll measures taken to combat this deadly virus are quite possibly founded upon nothing .\nFraud is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fraud is : \u201c Some deceitful practice or willful device , resorted to with intent to deprive another of his right , or in some manner to do him an injury.\n\u201d The Legal definition of a conspiracy is : \u201c A combination or confederacy between two or more persons formed for the purpose of committing , by their joint efforts , some unlawful or criminal act \u201d It seems , those who claim we face a pandemic have not provided any evidence to show that a virus called SARS-CoV-2 causes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information strongly suggesting this possibility is readily available in the public domain .\nAnyone can read it .\nFor there to be a fraud the deceit must be wilful .\nThe intention must be to deliberately deprive others of their rights or injure them in some other way .\nIf there is evidence of collusion between individuals ad/or organisations to commit fraud , then this is a conspiracy ( in Common Law jurisdictions ) or a Joint Criminal Enterprise ( JCE ) under International Law .\nIt seems COVID 19 has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage war on humanity .\nWe have been imprisoned in our own homes , our freedom to roam restricted

Police: When Questioning Official Narratives Becomes \u2018Terrorism\u2019", "content": "Whoever controls the ideological landscape controls the world .\nare from the Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , Neil Basu , published in the Evening Standard on 19th November .\nI have highlighted some keywords in capitals which I will refer to later in the analysis .\n\u201c Britain \u2019 s top counter-terrorism officer today called for a NATIONWIDE DEBATE on the introduction of new laws to punish people who spread ANTI-VACCINATION CONSPIRACY THEORIES.\n\u201d \u201c Met Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said that there should be a DISCUSSION about whether it is \u201c the correct thing for society to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT COULD COST PEOPLE \u2019 S LIVES \u201d as he responded to concern that false claims online could undermine the take up of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\u201d \u201c There is a DEBATE FOR SOCIETY to have about FREE SPEECH and responsibility and people who are spreading misinformation that could cost people \u2019 s lives \u201d Do you see what they \u2019 re trying to achieve ?\nThis propagandised message from the Met is attempting to reconstruct the ideological landscape , reframe the parameters of what a debate is , reclassify free speech , weaponise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle : \u2018 Innocent until proven guilty.\n\u2019 In other words , the government is attempting to whitewash free speech towards the kind of one world ideology that was endemic in the former Soviet Union , where thinking contrary to the ideology of the Communist Party was criminalised .\nBut there is something even more odious concealed within this Goebbelsian public service announcement : here we have a senior police officer using threatening language to intimidate and shakedown the general population .\nThis is on the very same day that Boris Johnson flexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for laser guns , direct energy weapons , an artificial intelligence agency and the creation of a national cyber force ( a group of computer hackers to conduct offensive operations ) .\nOffensive operations against who exactly ?\nBritain is not currently at war , but according to the Assistant Commissioner of the MET , the government is waging an ideological war against anti vaccination conspiracy theorists .\nIdeological wars of this nature typically take place online , which is where much of the government \u2019 s military budget is being invested .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government is at war with ?\nThese strong arm tactics by a fledgling totalitarian regime , learning its trade , could be interpreted as coercion against the British public , and it is likely that the government is not only targeting dissenters , skeptics or those unwilling to wear the uniform of the Red Army , they are in fact threatening the entire population .\nWe can therefore interpret the stern warning from the Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , as follows : 1 ) , DEBATES and DISCUSSIONS are permissible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of punishment to be served on those publicly voicing concerns or questioning the legitimacy or safety of vaccinations .\n2 ) , Despite the fact that a DEBATE and DISCUSSION is being proposed and this DEBATE is apparently open to all ( NATIONWIDE ) , ANTI-VACCINATION CONSPIRACY THEORISTS are not authorised to participate in this discussion .\nIn other words : if your own set of ideologies conflicts with state doctrine , you effectively have no voice .\nIn fact , your voice has already been criminalised , and it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far undetermined .\n3 ) , The proposed NATIONWIDE DEBATE is in fact a fiction , when the definition of debate is : \u2018 a regulated discussion between opposing views.\n\u2019 What \u2019 s more , there can be no debate without FREE SPEECH , which it is implied , does not exist anymore , because the war on MISINFORMATION and the ANTI-VACCINATION CONSPIRACY THEORISTS has established that the principle of free speech is , as a result of the threat of COVID , no longer permissible .\nAs the Met \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the DEBATE has already been silenced and criminalised .\nNeedless to say , the DEBATE does not involve the other side of the DEBATE .\nThis in turn implies that what is being proposed here is in fact a witch hunt and not a DEBATE .\n4 ) , An important legal precedent has now been established that overrides the principle of \u2018 innocent until Proven guilty.\n\u2019 due to the implied guilt of \u2018 ANTI-VACCINATION CONSPIRACY THEORISTS , without the enactment of legislation .\nIn other words , this witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened .\nWe can therefore assume that some kind of Kangaroo Court has taken place behind closed doors , without scrutiny or DEBATE from the legislative or judicial branches of government .\nThis in turn implies that the legal process for enacting laws is surpassed by arbitrary policing by preference .\n5 ) .\nDespite the word \u2018 NATIONWIDE \u2019 implying an open and transparent culture of DEBATE for everyone , as we have already established : the DEBATE will be mediated and directed by a small constituent belonging to one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of government ( the police ) , and its public relations agency ( the media ) .\n6 ) , The emergency powers which the government granted itself back in March , under the Public Health ( Control of Disease Act ) 1984 and the Coronavirus Act 2020 , not only abolished debates and scrutiny in parliament , these measures dissolved parliament from 650 MP \u2019 s to 50 MP \u2019 s .\nTherefore , If the constitutional affairs of this country can not be determined by lawmakers in parliament through DEBATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population would be invited into such a DEBATE .\nTherefore what is implicitly meant by the word DEBATE is official diktat .\n7 ) .\nThe notion that MISINFORMATION COULD COST PEOPLE \u2019 S LIVES , is one of the most dangerous legal propositions in the history of democracy .\nImplying the government has decreed a new category of criminal activity , equivalent to thought-crime .\nGranting the government powers to regulate our thoughts and communications .\nIf it can be argued that a person could be killed by misinformation , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 premeditation \u2019 , \u2018 motive \u2019 , and in turn \u2018 guilt \u2019 , are transformed into something else , and each of these parameters of guilt could be preceded by \u2018 thought \u2019 or \u2018 word \u2019 , as an incitement to cause injury or death .\nThis kind of legal precedent could therefore become an important weapon of censorship , the likes of which has not been attempted previously , and Orwell \u2019 s concept of Thought Crime might become a reality in the 21st century .\nThe intervention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this debate is especially alarming , because it presents evidence that the state is looking to brand anyone questioning the official narrative , with what it deems MISINFORMATION , as a terrorist .\n8 ) .\nAll systems of ideological control are concerned with dissolving the power of their opposition .\nWhether a political party looking to gain more seats in parliament or the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) prohibiting other political parties altogether .\nThe idea that a CONSPIRACY THEORIST presents a threat to people \u2019 s lives , grants unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , criminalise and prosecute its opposition .\nUnlike apartheid in South Africa \u2013 where a social segment was discrimanated against because of the colour of their skin \u2013 a conspiracy theorist is not identifiable by any incontrovertible features , and are instead singled out on the basis of the governments interpretation of their dissenting ideological stance .\nIt could therefore be argued that anyone disagreeing with the state , is in fact a CONSPIRACY THEORIST and open to prosecution .\n*** This article was originally published at Dustin

to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-spectrum dominance over the population .\nThe jobless ( and there will be many ) could be placed on some kind of universal basic income and have their debts ( indebtedness and bankruptcy on a massive scale is the deliberate result of lockdowns and restrictions ) written off in return for handing their assets to the state or more precisely the financial institutions helping to drive this great reset .\nThe WEF says the public will \u2018 rent \u2019 everything they require : stripping the right of ownership under the guise of \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet \u2019 .\nOf course , the tiny elite who rolled out this great reset will own everything .\nHundreds of millions around the world deemed \u2018 surplus to requirements \u2019 are to be robbed ( are currently being robbed ) of their livelihoods .\nOur every movement and purchase are to be monitored and our main dealings will be online .\nThe plan for individual citizens could reflect the strategy to be applied to nation states .\nFor instance , World Bank Group President David Malpass has stated that poorer countries will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their feet after the various lockdowns that have been implemented .\nThis \u2018 help \u2019 will be on condition that neoliberal reforms and the undermining of public services are implemented and become further embedded .\nOn 20 April , the Wall Street Journal ran the headline \u2018 IMF , World Bank Face Deluge of Aid Requests From Developing World .\nScores of countries are asking for bailouts and loans from financial institutions with $ 1.2 trillion to lend .\nAn ideal recipe for fuelling dependency .\nIn return for debt relief or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the likes of Bill Gates will be able to further dictate national policies and hollow out the remnants of nation state sovereignty .\nWhat will happen to our social and personal identity ?\nIs that to be eradicated in the quest to commodify and standardise human behaviour and everything we do ?\nThe billionaire class who are pushing this agenda think they can own nature and all humans and can control both , whether through geoengineering the atmosphere , for example , genetically modifying soil microbes or doing a better job than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lab .\nThey think they can bring history to a close and reinvent the wheel by reshaping what it means to be human .\nAnd they think they can achieve this by 2030 .\nIt is a cold dystopian vision that wants to eradicate thousands of years of culture , tradition and practices virtually overnight .\nAnd many of those cultures , traditions and practices relate to food and how we produce it and our deep-rooted connections to nature .\nConsider that many of the ancient rituals and celebrations of our forebears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped them come to terms with some of the most basic issues of existence , from death to rebirth and fertility .\nThese culturally embedded beliefs and practices served to sanctify their practical relationship with nature and its role in sustaining human life .\nAs agriculture became key to human survival , the planting and harvesting of crops and other seasonal activities associated with food production were central to these customs .\nFreyfaxi marks the beginning of the harvest in Norse paganism , for example , while Lammas or Lughnasadh is the celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHumans celebrated nature and the life it gave birth to .\nAncient beliefs and rituals were imbued with hope and renewal and people had a necessary and immediate relationship with the sun , seeds , animals , wind , fire , soil and rain and the changing seasons that nourished and brought life .\nOur cultural and social relationships with agrarian production and associated deities had a sound practical base .\nProf Robert W Nicholls explains that the cults of Woden and Thor were superimposed on far older and better-rooted beliefs related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crops and the animals and the rotation of the seasons between the light and warmth of summer and the cold and dark of winter .\nWe need look no further than India to appreciate the important relationship between culture , agriculture and ecology , not least the vital importance of the monsoon and seasonal planting and harvesting .\nRural-based beliefs and rituals steeped in nature persist , even among urban Indians .\nThese are bound to traditional knowledge systems where livelihoods , the seasons , food , cooking , processing , seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge are all inter-related and form the essence of cultural diversity within India itself .\nAlthough the industrial age resulted in a diminution of the connection between food and the natural environment as people moved to cities , traditional \u2018 food cultures \u2019 \u2013 the practices , attitudes and beliefs surrounding the production , distribution and consumption of food \u2013 still thrive and highlight our ongoing connection to agriculture and nature .\nIf we go back to the 1950s , it is interesting to note Union Carbide \u2019 s corporate narrative based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company as a \u2018 hand of god \u2019 coming out of the sky to \u2018 solve \u2019 some of the issues facing humanity .\nOne of the most famous images is of the hand pouring the firm \u2019 s agrochemicals on Indian soils as if traditional farming practices were somehow \u2018 backward \u2019 .\nDespite well-publicised claims to the contrary , this chemical-driven approach did not lead to higher food production according to the paper \u2018 New Histories of the Green Revolution \u2019 written by Prof Glenn Stone .\nHowever , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic consequences ( see Vandana Shiva \u2019 s book \u2018 The Violence of the Green Revolution \u2019 and Bhaskar Save \u2019 s now famous and highly insightful open letter to Indian officials ) .\nIn the book \u2018 Food and Cultural Studies \u2019 ( Bob Ashley et al ) , we see how , some years ago , a Coca Cola TV ad campaign sold its product to an audience which associated modernity with a sugary drink and depicted ancient Aboriginal beliefs as harmful , ignorant and outdated .\nCoke and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parched .\nThis type of ideology forms part of a wider strategy to discredit traditional cultures and portray them as being deficient and in need of assistance from \u2018 god-like \u2019 corporations .\nWhat we are seeing in 2020 , is an acceleration of such processes .\nIn terms of food and agriculture , traditional farming in places like India will be under increasing pressure from the big-tech giants and agribusiness to open up to lab-grown food , GMOs , genetically engineered soil microbes , data harvesting tools and drones and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reset includes farmerless farms being manned by driverless machines , monitored by drones and doused with chemicals to produce commodity crops from patented GM seeds for industrial \u2018 biomatter \u2019 to be processed and constituted into something resembling food .\nWhat will happen to the farmers ?\nPost-COVID , the World Bank talks about helping countries get back on track in return for structural reforms .\nAre tens of millions of smallholder farmers to be enticed from their land in return for individual debt relief and universal basic income ?\nThe displacement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural communities and their cultures was something the Gates Foundation once called for and cynically termed \u201c land mobility \u201d .\nCut through the euphemisms and it is clear that Bill Gates \u2013 and the other incredibly rich individuals behind the great reset \u2013 is an old-fashioned colonialist who supports the time-honoured dispossessive strategies of imperialism , whether this involves mining , appropriating and commodifying farmer knowledge , accelerating the transfer of research and seeds to corporations or facilitating intellectual property piracy and seed monopolies created through IP laws and seed regulations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrarian-based society \u2013 will the land of these already ( prior to COVID ) heavily indebted farmers then be handed over to the tech giants , the financial institutions and global agribusiness to churn out their high-tech , data-driven GM industrial sludge ?\nIs this part of the \u2018 own nothing , be happy \u2019 bland brave new world being promoted by the WEF ?\nWith the link completely severed between food production , nature and culturally embedded beliefs that give meaning and expression to life , we will be left with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is reliant on income from the state and who is stripped of satisfying productive endeavour and genuine self-fulfilment .\nTechnocratic meddling has already destroyed or undermined cultural diversity , meaningful social connections and agrarian ecosystems that draw on centuries of traditional knowledge and are increasingly recognised as valid approaches to secure food security ( for example , see \u2018 Food Security and Traditional Knowledge in India \u2019 in the Journal of South Asian Studies ) .\nThe massive technocratic transformation currently envisaged regards humans as commodities to be controlled and monitored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI being promoted .\nBut do not worry \u2013 you will be property-less and happy in your open prison of mass unemployment , state dependency , track and chip health passports , cashlessness , mass vaccination and dehumanisation .\nThis article was originally published at Global Research .\nSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A

Lockdowns Never Worked", "content": "Exactly 400 years ago , 102 Pilgrims were staring down what promised to be a brutal winter , after first coming to shore , and setting up a tiny village in Plymouth , Massachusetts .\nThe industrious , God-fearing Pilgrims decided to pull together and pool their resources and efforts to better survive winter .\nThey created a commune , and elected a Governor to call the shots .\nBy the spring of 1621 , half of the Pilgrims had died from starvation , disease , and exposure .\nOne of the Pilgrims , William Bradford , explained in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.\n\u201d Young single men found it unjust that they had to do all the hard work , but received no more reward for it .\nAnd wives \u201c deemed it a kind of slavery \u201d to be forced to do chores for men besides their husbands .\nClearly , this little experiment in collectivizing society had failed .\nSo they reversed course , and tried something new ; every man for himself .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut on the contrary , Bradford explained : This had very good success , for it made all hands very industrious , so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been by any means the Governor or any other could use\u2026 The women now went willingly into the field , and took their little ones with them to set corn ; which before would allege weakness and inability ; whom to have compelled would have been thought great tyranny and oppression .\n400 years later , it seems leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering winter grappling with COVID-19 , a lockdown-stunted economy , and as I noted Monday , millions of hungry Americans relying on food banks to survive .\nAnd tyrannical governments seem to be doing everything they can to stop us from responding to these problems as we see fit .\nWe \u2019 ve been told to abandon any sense of reason , trust the experts , and \u201c listen to the scientists \u201d .\nBut this month , New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a study to test the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of COVID-19 .\nThe study , which enforced a strict quarantine and social distancing regimen on Marine recruits , found there is no correlation between strict lockdowns and reduced COVID-19 transmission .\nIn fact the control group , which went about life as normal , had a lower percentage of COVID infections ( 1.7 % ) compared to the test group under strict lockdown ( 2 % ) .\nSo , will Governors \u201c listen to the scientists \u201d ?\nHardly .\nSeveral states are going so far as to attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strict limit on the number of family members you can invite to your own home to share a meal .\nOregon recently decriminalized hard drugs\u2013 invite five people over to smoke crack , and you \u2019 re all good .\nBut if you are caught sharing a Thanksgiving meal with seven family members , you could face 30 days in jail and a $ 1,250 fine .\nCalifornia says you can host no more than two other families , but everyone must stay outside , with guests seated six feet apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California will graciously allow your houseguests to enter your home\u2026 but only to use the bathroom .\nBut these are just the latest authoritarian escalations , which should surprise no one .\nSince March , Governors have simply been ruling by decree to shut down businesses , define who is an essential employee , and stop people from earning a living , even though courts have deemed these lockdowns unconstitutional .\nBut governors are ignoring the courts and imposing lockdowns anyway .\nAnd we see the results\u2013 11 million out of work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government debt , and a pandemic that has still not been controlled , despite the restrictions .\nIt took a 50 % death rate from disease and hunger in Plymouth in the winter of 1620 to convince the Pilgrims that controlling people wasn \u2019 t saving lives , or creating prosperity .\nBut individual liberty accomplished what authoritarianism and communism could not .\nNow more than ever people need the freedom to make their own decisions , to decide for themselves if they want to open their businesses , earn a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Thanksgiving meal .\nAnd if those basic freedoms which we all took for granted just one year ago seem out of reach , take one more lesson from the Pilgrims .\nThey hopped in a tiny wooden boat , and crossed the Atlantic at great personal risk just to have a shot at building a free life by their own design .\nToday , it is not nearly as dangerous or difficult to find greener pastures .\nJust removing yourself from a city goes a long way , as does settling amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn you in to the Gestapo for celebrating Thanksgiving .\nBut also , don \u2019 t be afraid to look overseas .\nWhen people think that your personal liberty is a threat to them , it makes sense to at least consider the possibility that at some point , your home country may no longer be right for you .\n*** This article was originally published at Sovereign Man .\nSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING &

.\nHowever , the damage is not only confined to the classroom and academic achievement \u2013 this tragedy extends to other areas of child development , as schools play an important role feeding , counseling , and accommodate their various unique needs on a day to day basis .\nDue to erroneous claims by public health officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PCR positive tests are not genuine \u2018 cases \u2019 , nor are they real \u2018 infections \u2019 either ) , the public are facing what have become near permanent school closures , which are negatively affecting families and communities who rely educational institutions for so many different things .\nFirst and foremost though , is what is being called the \u201c loss of learning \u201d \u2013 a chronic condition which has already set-back students across all age groups .\nThis may be the single biggest institutional failure of modern times .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to make the baseless claim that children and teachers are \u201c not safe from COVID \u201d in schools \u2013 especially since children are at practically zero risk of contracting any serious illness due to COVID19 , as are most teachers under the age of 60 .\nEven veteran New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof admitted recently that President Donald Trump was in fact right since the spring when insisting that children are better off in schools for in-person learning .\nKristof wrote : \u201c Trump has been demanding for months that schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been largely right .\nSchools , especially elementary schools , do not appear to have been major sources of coronavirus transmission , and remote learning is proving to be a catastrophe for many low-income children.\n\u201d Indeed , UNESCO has already issued a dire warning to western governments who seem content to \u2018 write-off \u2019 the futures of this current generation under the guise of the \u2018 protecting children and teachers from a raging pandemic \u2019 .\nThe UN body issued the following statement and list of problems arising from reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high social and economic costs for people across communities .\nTheir impact however is particularly severe for the most vulnerable and marginalized boys and girls and their families .\nThe resulting disruptions exacerbate already existing disparities within the education system but also in other aspects of their lives .\nThese include : \u2022 Interrupted learning : Schooling provides essential learning and when schools close , children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development .\nThe disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth rely on free or discounted meals provided at schools for food and healthy nutrition .\nWhen schools close , nutrition is compromised .\n\u2022 Confusion and stress for teachers : When schools close , especially unexpectedly and for unknown durations , teachers are often unsure of their obligations and how to maintain connections with students to support learning .\nTransitions to distance learnign platforms tend to be messy and frustrating , even in the best circumstances .\nIn many contexts , school closures lead to furloughs or seperations for teachers .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When schools close , parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task .\nThis is especially true for parents with limited education and resources .\n\u2022 Challenges creating , maintaining , and improving distance learning : Demand for distance learning skyrockets when schools close and often overwhelms existing portals to remote education .\nMoving learning from classrooms

easily attend work because of childcare obligations that result from school closures .\nThis means that many medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are most needed during a health crisis .\n\u2022 Increased pressure on schools and school systems that remain open : Localized school closures place burdens on schools as governments and parents alike redirect children to schools that remain open .\n\u2022 Rise in dropout rates : It is a challenge to ensure children and youth return and stay in school when schools reopen after closures .\nThis is especially true of protracted closures and when economic shocks place pressure on children to work and generate income for financially distressed families .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When schools shut down , early marriages increase , more children are

out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective effect is small , masks should be worn diligently wherever recommended .\nThe main benefit of masks is the \u2018 source control \u2019 effect , where other people are

but the vaccine is still a favorite with the Gates Foundation and developing countries .\nAstraZeneca \u2019 s COVID vaccine faced new controversy this week after a trial participant in India alleged that the vaccine caused him serious \u201c neurological and psychological \u201d symptoms .\nThe accusation was the latest in a series of complaints or concerns surrounding Covishield , the AstraZeneca vaccine being developed in partnership with Oxford University .\nYet despite concerns about safety and trial design , countries are already spending billions of dollars in taxpayer funds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part because , compared with frontrunners Moderna and Pfizer , AstraZeneca \u2019 s vaccine is easier to store and faster to distribute .\nThe latest news also hasn \u2019 t changed plans by the Global Alliance for Vaccine Initiative ( GAVI ) , a public-private partnership founded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , to distribute the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine globally , once it \u2019 s approved .\nOn Nov. 21 , a 40-year-old participant in AstraZeneca \u2019 s clinical trial , who lives in India , sent a legal notice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccine caused him to develop acute neuro encephalopathy .\nIn the notice , the participant said he \u201c must be compensated , in the least , for all the sufferings that he and his family have undergone and are likely to undergo in the future.\n\u201d The Serum Institute , which has a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture a billion doses of the vaccine , maintains that the participant \u2019 s medical complications are unrelated to the vaccine trial .\nA spokesperson for the Institute said the trial participant is \u201c falsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the COVID vaccine trial \u201d and that \u201c it is evident that the intention behind the spreading of such malicious information is an oblique pecuniary motive.\n\u201d A statement released by the Institute claimed that they are \u201c sympathetic with the volunteers medical condition \u201d but also that they claim to take legal action against the injured participant for maligning the company \u2019 s reputation , seeking damages in excess of $ 13 million .\nOn Tuesday , Indian Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that the adverse event \u201c will not affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bioethicists and scientists are questioning the ethics of the Serum Institute , which has received at least $ 18.6 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\n\u201c This is the first time I have ever heard of a sponsor threatening a trial participant , \u201d said Dr. Amar Jesani , editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics .\nDr. John Jacob , virologist and former professor at Christian Medical College , agreed the actions of the institute were uncalled for .\nHe told the Times of India , \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after the adverse event was reported .\nAnd within a week it could have been investigated .\nThat would have instilled confidence and trust in the minds of people .\nStonewalling , refusing to answer , waiting for a lawsuit to bring things out , it speaks volumes about the lack of professionalism.\n\u201d This wasn \u2019 t the first time a trial participant has complained that the AstraZeneca vaccine caused a neurological injury .\nIn July , a trial volunteer developed symptoms of transverse myelitis , a rare debilitating neurological disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global trials were temporarily paused after another participant in the UK developed symptoms also consistent with transverse myelitis .\nIn October , a participant in Brazil died , though in that case , AstraZeneca suggested that the person was part of the control group and thus hadn \u2019 t received the COVID-19 vaccine .\nThe Brazil trial wasn \u2019 t paused .\nCovishield trials are currently taking place in the UK , South Africa , Brazil and Japan .\nAs reported by The Defender in November , according to the company \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of AstraZeneca \u2019 s vaccine during Phase I/II trials in the UK to cause more than 50 % of participants to experience adverse events .\nIf the AstraZeneca vaccine , once approved , does produce harmful side effects and adverse reactions in the U.S. , the company won \u2019 t be held accountable .\nIn March 2020 , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a COVID-19-specific declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act , providing liability immunity \u201c against any claim of loss caused by , arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from the manufacture , distribution , administration , or use of medical countermeasures , \u201d including COVID-19 vaccines .\nThe European Union and Australia have also followed suit , indemnifying vaccine manufacturers from liability .\nIn addition to reports of vaccine-related injuries , there have been other problems with AstraZeneca \u2019 s trials .\nFor example , trial administrators gave the control group in the UK Pfizer \u2019 s Nimenrix , a meningitis vaccine .\nA saline solution is the gold standard placebo because researchers can be sure it won \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s meningitis vaccine as a placebo allows AstraZeneca to undercut any adverse reactions in its COVID vaccine group by showing the control group suffered adverse reactions as well .\n\u201c The meningitis vaccine in the AstraZeneca trial is what I would call a \u2018 fauxcebo , \u2019 a fake control whose real purpose is to disguise or hide injury in the vaccine group , \u201d said Mary Holland , general counsel at Children \u2019 s Health Defense .\n\u201c The trial sponsor can say , \u2018 look , the vaccine group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 when in fact the trial proves that the control group was as dangerous as the vaccine group.\n\u201d In a tweet , Oxford University \u2019 s Oxford Vaccine Group explained the decision , stating that it only made sense to use Pfizer \u2019 s meningitis vaccine as a placebo because \u201c otherwise participants who have any reaction to the injection would be able to guess that they had received the ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 vaccine , \u201d indicating that adverse reactions are expected .\nIn November , AstraZeneca released data showing a 90 % efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only 2,741 participants in the test group .\nDr. Saad Omer , director of the Yale Institute for Global Health , told CNN that the test group was \u201c relatively small \u201d and said \u201c it might not hold up when more people are given this regimen.\n\u201d After releasing the data , AstraZeneca acknowledged a \u201c mistake \u201d in the amount of vaccine given to some trial participants .\nThat news led the New York Times to report that the company had undercut its own credibility .\n\u201c I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole development program , \u201d Geoffrey Porges , an analyst for the investment bank SVB Leerink , told the Times .\nDr. Natalie Dean , a biostatistician and expert in vaccine trial design at the University of Florida , wrote on Twitter that overall , Oxford and AstraZeneca get \u201c a poor grade for transparency and rigor when it comes to the vaccine trial results they have reported.\n\u201d Price , speed and connections to Gates Foundation key to big contracts At only a few dollars a dose , Covishield is often hailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster to distribute compared with the vaccines developed by frontrunners Pfizer and Moderna .\nAs CNN reported , Covishield will \u201c be far easier to transport and distribute in developing countries than its rivals.\n\u201d When the Thomson Reuters Foundation asked several experts which COVID-19 vaccine could \u201c reach the poorest soonest , \u201d all three who answered declared a preference for the AstraZeneca candidate .\nOxford and AstraZeneca already have a plan to provide more than 1 billion doses of their vaccine , commonly referred to as the COVID-19 vaccine that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developing world .\nEurope will receive 400 million doses of the vaccine while the U.S. and GAVI will receive 700 million doses , and India 1 billion doses .\nThe company \u2019 s plan relies heavily on its connections to the Gates Foundation .\nDr. Andrew Pollard , director of the Oxford Vaccine Group which is producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine , is tightly intertwined with the Gates Foundation .\nHis employer , the University of Oxford , has received $ 11 million for vaccine development research from the foundation over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grants over the past decade .\nIn 2016 , the Gates Foundation gave $ 36 million for research into vaccine development by a team of researchers which was headed by Pollard .\nIn addition , Pollard \u2019 s private laboratory is funded by the

for Biological Standards and Control Scientific Advisory Committee , which advises the Medicines and Healthcare Products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s ties to Oxford , AstraZeneca , the Gates Foundation and

Aftermath of the Attack on Artsakh", "content": "Now that Turkey has become a presidential one-party state ruled by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( aka the Prez ) , like in Ottoman times , the country \u2019 s affairs are once again being run from the palace \u2013 the Be\u015ftepe Palace in Ankara , to be precise .\nLiving in this huge palace in conjunction with his wife Emine , the one-time humble and modest Erdo\u011fan has now become a man whom his critics call a \u201c billionaire several times over , \u201d holding \u201c at least eight Swiss bank accounts \u201d and who has in the past \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never resolved due to his parliamentary immunity .\nIn spite of these allegations of sheer avarice and rank corruption , or \u201c the misuse of public power for private benefit , \u201d as an individual , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is deeply attached to his religion and he has been at pains to implement what I have termed a veritable \u2018 policy of Sunnification \u2019 in the country in an effort to \u2018 make Turkey Muslim again.\n\u2019 Over the past years , Erdo\u011fan has skillfully used his Justice and Development Party ( or AKP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an Islamic state in all but name called the New Turkey , well and truly embarked on a post-Kemalist path leading further and further away from Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk ( 1881-1938 ) \u2019 s example and principles .\nStill , this seemingly novel political construct more often than not relies on policies and relationships harking back to the good old day when Turkish nationalism was all but synonymous with the Kemalism .\nRecently , Turkey \u2019 s traditionally close ties to the Turkic nation state on the Caspian Sea have been revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s independence on 9 November 1991 , \u201d prior to the official fall of the Soviet Union ( 26 December 1991 ) , and the recent revival of cordiality has also led to the outbreak of a new war in the Southern Caucasus .\nIn this way , the Prez has suddenly become very close to Azerbaijan \u2019 s strongman , President Ilham Aliyev , whom the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project ( or OCCRP ) awarded the epithet \u201c Corrupt Person of the Year \u201d in 2012 .\nAs a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Prez and his Azerbaijani strongman are nothing but a couple of swells , whose personal proclivities are now also matched by their public policies , bringing Ankara and Baku even closer together .\nBetween 27 September 2020 and 10 November 2020 ( or six weeks all together ) , the Republic of Azerbaijan attacked Armenian positions in the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh ( known as Artsakh , to Armenians ) as well as targets in Armenia proper .\nThough the Armenian side displayed a lot of bravado during the conflict , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pashinyan agreed to Russian mediation in order to bring an end to further bloodshed .\nThe resultant agreement was hailed as a victory by Azerbaijan and its brother-in-arms , Turkey .\nIn fact , in the succeeding hours a video recording of the Azerbaijani strongman Aliyev emerged on social media , with the latter mocking Armenia \u2019 s PM , ostentatiously asking , \u201c What happened Pashinyan ?\n\u201d Six Weeks That Did Not Shake The World As I have previously outlined , for a whole range of reasons , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Azerbaijani attack : \u201c It was with Turkey \u2019 s funding , munitions and guidance that Azerbaijan attacked Artsakh on Sept. 27 , 2020 , \u201c declared the Armenian politician Raffi K. Hovannisian assuredly ( on 21 October 2020 ) .\nAccording to the Armenian authorities , a grand total of 2,425 of its soldiers have perished in the conflict , as reported by the Associated Pres ( or AP ) .\nOn Twitter , however , the independent journalist and analyst Neil Hauer estimates that \u201c [ l ] osses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war : based on the amount of soldiers still missing and presumed dead , they are starting to talk about 7-8,000 or even *10,000* dead .\nIn 44 days.\n\u201d adding in a subsequent tweet that \u201c [ n ] one of this is official , obviously , just estimates I have heard from well-informed locals involved in search efforts , etc.\n\u201d The AP \u2019 s Avet Demourian then adds that a \u201c hundreds , possibly thousands [ have been killed ] , in six weeks , but [ Russia-brokered cease-fire ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some areas it holds outside Nagorno-Karabakh \u2019 s borders to Azerbaijan.\n\u201d Still , the now-beleagered Pashinyan took to Facebook to assure his people and possibly keep the door open for any future resistance : In Azerbaijan , on the other hand , the Russian-brokered road map was seen as a declaration of victory .\nThe Azerbaijani writer Cavid Aga , on Twitter , gave voice to the sentiment on the street : \u201c Since the announcement of [ a ] ceasefire , [ the ] Azerbaijani public has gone from one mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they celebrated , made feasts , paraded.\n\u201d Next stating that \u201c three dominant groups have [ subsequently ] formed in society , \u201d with the first being \u201c satisfied with current outcome , \u201d a second group , on the other hand , wanting the \u201c war to continue , \u201d and a third , desirous of \u201c Turkish peacekeepers beside Russians as they don \u2019 t trust the latter.\n\u201d The Russian-brokered document itself is unequivocal , starting off that a \u201c complete ceasefire and termination of all hostilities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting 12:00 am ( midnight ) Moscow time on November 10.\n\u201d The plan gave the Azerbaijani side considerable territorial gains : the \u201c Agdam District shall be returned to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 20 , 2020 \u201d and the \u201c Republic of Armenia shall return the Kalbajar District to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 15 , 2020 , and the Lachin District by December 1 , 2020.\n\u201d Still , a \u201c Lachin Corridor ( 5 km wide ) , which will provide a connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shusha , shall remain under the control of the Russian Federation peacemaking forces.\n\u201d This means that the Kremlin shall remain an active player in the Southern Caucasus for the foreseeable future .\nIn other words , though not quite reviving the 11-article Treaty of Kurekchay ( 14 May 1805 ) , the current peace treaty of sorts ensures that Russia will continue to be a palpable presence locally .\nIn contrast , Turkey also wants to be part of the configuration , with the all-but-impotent Turkish Parliament ( or , TBMM ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 17 November to deploy Turkish troops to Azerbaijan to serve at a joint monitoring mission , in conjunction with Russia that has been tasked to \u201c watch and inspect a ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\u201d The head of Turkey \u2019 s Parliamentiary Defense Commission , \u0130smet Y\u0131lmaz pointedly and arguably somewhat idealistically remarked that the \u201c Turkish presence in Azerbaijan and Karabakh is of vital importance for the protection of the historic victory.\n\u201d Previously , on Twitter , the AKP-member Y\u0131lmaz had proclaimed his wish that the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the \u201c heavens of Karabakh.\n\u201d In reality though , the Russians gave the Turks quite a cold shower in this respect , in spite of having set up a joint Russian-Turkish monitoring center for control of ceasefire observance in Azerbaijan , and having deployed \u201c some 2,000 Russian peacekeepers \u201d to Nagorno-Karabakh , yet remaining firm that Turkish boots be firmly off the ground .\nRussian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quite vocal in this respect : \u201c one needs to understand clearly that we are not talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a different mission.\n\u201d Russia clearly calls the shots and has granted Turkey a face-saving role on Azerbaijani soil but has made sure to keep Turkish troops away from the conflict zone proper , that is Nagorno-Karabakh .\nNow Armenians are busily vacating the grounds handed back to Azerbaijan , burning their houses before abandoning the area , as can be seen on numerous video recordings spread into the world via social media , particularly on Twitter .\nThese scorched earth efforts appear puzzling , but seem to point towards some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for the Azerbaijanis .\nDr. Gayane Novikova points out the presence of a \u201c singular victim complex among Armenians [ as a collection of individuals ] who had been struggling for survival for centuries \u201d \u2013 victims who , rightly or wrongly , feel particularly persecuted by \u2018 Turks.\n\u2019 And in this context , Armenians regard Turks , Azerbaijanis or Tatars as interchangeable names for people having \u201c initiated any and all threatening actions and violence against Armenians.\n\u201d Novikova maintains that \u201c owing to historical experience and memory , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy \u2019 category in the perceptions of broad cross sections of Armenians.\n\u201d Dr Novikova here seems to slyly refer to the Armenian Genocide as a crime against humanity perpetrated by the Ottoman government , but popularly ascribed to the \u201c Turks , \u201d as a general derogatory name for bloodthirsty homicidal maniacs , ethnically related to Azerbaijanis .\nA recent report by the RT journalist Murad Gazdiev all but underlines this assessment .\nGazdiev presents an Armenian couple called \u201c Lilit \u201d and \u201c Igor , \u201d who have lived in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Armenians as Karvajar or Karvatchar ) region for the past 17 years .\nThey had even built the house with their own hands .\nAs a school teacher Lilit seems to possess large swathes of empathy and is thus unwilling to burn down the house they are going to abandon .\nSuddenly , her husband gets upset , saying \u201c To hell with them , I am going to burn it down , burn it right down.\n\u201d This couple now has to abandon their home in accordance with the stipulations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have inhabited for 17 years , or since 2003 .\nThe home they built on territory in one of the \u201c seven districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh \u201d that Armenia occupied in the aftermath of the signature of the provisional ceasefire agreement known as the Bishkek Protocol on 5 May 1994 .\nIn other words , they were settlers that have now been forced to vacate the location they took over .\nAs explained by Eurasianet \u2019 s Caucasus editor Joshua Kucera about two years ago , the \u201c seven surrounding territories had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ] instead inhabited mainly by Azerbaijanis and Kurds .\nAs a result of the war [ that took place between 20 February 1988 and 12 May 1994 ] they were emptied of their population and about 618,000 Azerbaijanis remain displaced from the conflict , according to United Nations figures , the large majority of those from the seven districts.\n\u201d In the early years of the 21st century , the Armenian authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh started to establish their own government infrastructure in the \u201c occupied \u201d or \u201c liberated \u201d territories .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the incorporation of these seven territories into the de facto Republic of Artsakh .\nThe Senior South Caucasus Analyst at the International Crisis Group , Olesya Vartanyan puts forward that settlement \u201c became a clear policy of the local [ Artsakh ] leadership \u201d in 2007 , adding that \u201c [ r ] oads were built , many problems with electricity resolved , new schools built , houses repaired , and so on .\nAll was done to support the existing [ settler ] population in the [ newly acquired ] territories.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel any sympathy for the Muslim \u201c Azerbaijanis and Kurds \u201d whom they had in large measure replaced .\nBut now , on 25 November 2020 , Azerbaijan \u2019 s Defense Ministry announced summarily that \u201c units of the Azerbaijan Army [ have ] entered the Kalbajar region , \u201d in accordance with a trilateral statement signed by the presidents of the Republic of Azerbaijan , the Russian Federation and the prime minister of the Republic of Armenia \u2013 the event dreaded by \u201c Lilit \u201d and \u201c Igor.\n\u201d Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c President Ilham Aliyev and [ his ] First Lady \u201d ostentatiously visited the Juma mosque in the ghost town of Aghdam , that had been abandoned during the 1988-94 war .\nOn Twitter , the Turkish journalist of Armenian descent ( and actually residing in Armenia ) Alin Ozinian adds that Aliyev , dressed up in a military uniform , performed prayers and bequeathed a copy of the Quran that had come form the holy city of Mecca to the mosque .\nOzinian cheekily remarks that Azerbaijan \u2019 s President couldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear in order to perform this strange act , which she calls a \u201c cocktail of Jihadism-militarism-pan-Turkism.\n\u201d Ozinian \u2019 s analysis shows the extent to which Aliyev has now apparently become subject to Erdo\u011fan \u2018 s role model , as a \u201c \u2019 Turkist-Islamist \u2019 Soviet leftover , \u201d in Ozinian \u2019 s words , who is now trying to realign himself on an axis congruent with the New Turkey \u2019 s policy of Sunnification , albeit that the Azerbaijani nation adheres to the Shi \u2019 a version of Islam .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Turkish nationalism and militarism that characterizes the New Turkey \u2019 s post-Kemalist era seems to exude a heady allure , apparently easily able to trangress confessional borders and migrate from Sunni to Shi \u2019 a climes .\nArtem Avdalyan , a Lieutenant Colonel in the Armenian army , states clearly that \u201c [ f ] ollowing the Bishkek agreement , Azerbaijan focused its efforts both on the development of its energy export based economy and in the rapid increase of its military capabilities.\n\u201d This heightened military fire-power not coincidentally also emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out beyond its traditional boundaries within the framework of the Partnership for Peace programme , which also encompassed Azerbaijan .\nBaku \u2019 s hydrocarbon wealth led to a \u201c windfall of revenues \u201d that in turn gave rise to increased spending on military expenditure : from a meagre $ 240 million in 1998 to a whopping $ 1.453 billion in 2007 , reaching the heights of $ 2 billion in 2012 and dropping off to $ 1.6 billion in 2018 .\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute indicates that Armenia \u2019 s \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given less leeway for increased spending on .\n.\n.\nthe military .\n.\n.\nsector.\n\u201d Yet , the unresolved \u2018 frozen conflict \u2019 in Nagorno-Karabakh was clearly the main reason for Baku \u2019 s spending spree and this year \u2019 s six-week war was all but its logical outcome .\nIn addition to its own awesome military firepower , the Azerbaijani side also relied on a \u201c fleet of Israeli and Turkish drones \u201d that has inflicted major damage on \u201c Armenian tanks , air defences and heavy weapons.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that so-called Israeli \u2018 kamikaze drones \u2019 \u201c reportedly make up a portion of Azerbaijan \u2019 s arsenal.\n\u201d Various users on social media have posted video footage of these drones destroying Armenian positions and hardware , in particular the Orbiter 1K drone .\nProduced by the Israeli Aeronautics Group , this unmanned aerial vehicle is a \u201c loiter munition platform , based on the combat proven , mature Orbiter 2 MUAS with the fuselage adapted for explosive payloads.\n\u201d In fact , Israel \u2019 s state-owned aerospace manufacturer , IAI ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 signed a $ 1.6 billion contract with Baku , in a clear effort to take advantage of the \u201c windfall of revenues \u201d that were re-directed to military expenditure eyeing the eventual re-ignition of the \u2018 frozen conflict \u2019 in Nagorno-Karabakh .\nThe fact that Israel has over the years become the Middle East \u2019 s high-tech production hub , including the manufacture of sophisticated weaponry , has led to this , at first sight , somewhat odd relationship between the Caspian oil-and-gas powerhouse and the Jewish state located in Palestine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c Israel receives about half of its crude oil supply from Azerbaijan , \u201d as pointed out by the Yerevan-based David Davidian .\nIn fact , President Aliyev himself is reported to have likened this relationship to an iceberg by stating that \u201c nine-tenths of it is below the surface.\n\u201d Closer to home , Baku has also relied on Ankara to acquire unmanned killing machines able to get the job done without any significant risk or danger .\nLike Israel , AKP-led New Turkey has also been trying hard to transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-tech killing gadgets \u2013 as worded by the freelance journalist Ferhat Gurini , \u201c Turkey \u2019 s growing defense industry is a cornerstone of Erdogan \u2019 s independent and assertive foreign policy.\n\u201d In this respect , the Be\u015ftepe Palace is but following good old Turkish precedent , the Presidency of Defence Industries ( Savunma Sanayii Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131 ) having been set up as long ago as 1985 .\nFollowing the example of the not-quite Islamist ( he was nevertheless openly affiliated with the Naqshbandi brotherhood ) but outspoken neoliberal Turgut \u00d6zal ( 1927-93 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships , with such by now prominent firms like ASELSAN , HAVELSAN and TAI .\nOriginally , this deadly hardware was destined solely for Turkey \u2019 s Armed Forces ( or TSK , in acronymized Turkish ) , but the demands of capitalist expansion have led to Turkey now also exporting weapons systems to other countries \u2013 such as , Kazakhstan , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , Malaysia , the UAE , Indonesia and , significantly , Azerbaijan .\nRecently , Turkey \u2019 s arms industry has specialized in the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having seemingly acquired the expertise from Israel after IAI sold drone technology to the TSK .\nFor Turkey and Israel have enjoyed a \u201c secret but close \u201d defense relationship since the late fifties , as alleged by the Israeli writer and journalist Yossi Melman .\nHe explains that \u201c [ o ] ver the years , especially in the 1980s and 1990s , Israel \u2019 s defence industries sold arms to Turkey , which included intelligence equipment , missiles avionics and upgraded tanks and planes , \u201d amounting to a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange has now resulted in the NewTurkey \u2019 s blooming arms industry .\nIn recent years , Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and Anka-S drones have been deployed all over the place \u2013 in Syria , Iraq , and Libya , but now also in the Southern Caucasus .\nLast June , the \u201c Azeri parliament approved a bill to receive financial assistance from Turkey to be used for the purchase of weapons systems.\n\u201d And Baku then went ahead and used these funds to buy Ankara \u2019 s Bayraktar TB2 drones \u2013 \u201c developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baykar Makina and the Kale Group.\n\u201d The Washington Post \u2018 s foreign correspondent Robyn Dixon explains that Azerbaijan used these Turkish drones to good effect to kill \u201c Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh soldiers and destroy tanks , artillery and air defense systems.\n\u201d Last October then , Azerbaijan \u2019 s strongman Ilham Aliyev appeared on the Turkish state broadcaster TRT to tell the brotherly nation that \u201c [ t ] hanks to advanced Turkish drones owned by the Azerbaijan military , our casualties on the front shrunk .\n.\n.\nThese drones show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowers us.\n\u201d While on social media , video footage of the Azerbaijani use of these Turkish weapons was distributed as well : \u201c Azerbaijan Armed Forces is continuing to destroy enemy positions and vehicles with the aerial assaults conducted by Bayraktar TB2 Armed UAVs.\n\u201d During his TRT appearance , Azerbaijan \u2019 s strongman did not seem to hide his admiration for the Prez : \u201c Turkey has the second strongest army among NATO countries , and we are building a small model of this Army.\n\u201d Ethnic Cleansing and Memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Turkey and Azerbaijan have populations that are ethnically Turkic and that both people adhere to the religion of Islam , albeit one being Sunni and the other Shi \u2019 a , did Ankara have any ulterior motives in providing Baku with support and leadership ?\n!\n?\nIn this context , the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) \u2019 s resident scholar Dr Michael Rubin has recently put forward an interesting suggestion .\nRubin namely argues that the Turkish and Azerbaijani strongmen want to \u201c replicate \u201d Operation Peace Spring \u2018 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tayyip Erdo\u011fan pursued his plan of having Sunni Syrian refugees replace Kurdish civilians in northern Syria , at the time he had actually been thinking about re-settling \u201c 2 million Syrians.\n\u201d In fact , the outspoken Erdo\u011fan critic contends that AKP-led Ankara has been employing Sunni Syrians inside Turkey in a similar fashion , in attempts to neutralize \u201c predominantly Alevi areas in Hatay \u201d and \u201c Kurdish towns and villages in southeastern Turkey.\n\u201d Regarding Nagorno-Karabakh , Rubin reasons that \u201c ridding the region of Christians \u201d is the ultimate goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azeris want to live there , \u201d given its landlocked status and the opportunities and job prospects contained in Azerbaijan proper .\nDr Rubin spells out his suggestion as follows : Rubin \u2019 s interpretation is all but congruent with accusations of ethnic cleansing and human rights \u2019 abuses , uttered by many Armenians and documented on social media .\nFor example , on 29 October 2020 , a Twitter user calling themselves Anna posted an AP video showing the shelling of a hospital in the Artsakh capital of Stepanakert , adding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artsakh without Armenians , and their aim is the ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Artsakh.\n\u201c A German internet user called Dennis is particularly active in this respect , making \u2018 objective \u2019 videos on the war in Nagorno-Karabakh using the name Vagabondings for his YouTube channel .\nAnd he really does a good job , documenting \u2018 war crimes \u2019 and \u2018 crimes against humanity.\n\u2019 His internet-based activism has even led to a certain degree of mainstream media recognition , as illustrated by an interview conducted by Los Angeles-based KTTV FOX11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor Araksya Karapetyan .\nThis plethora of social media activity has now even led the \u201c Azerbaijani authorities [ to tell BBC Azeri that ] they are looking into the beheading video circulating on social media as well as other gruesome images that appear to show war crimes being committed by their servicemen in Karabakh , \u201d as related by the BBC News journalist Grigor Atanesian on Twitter ( 23 November 2020 ) .\nIn parallel to Armenians \u2019 apparent outspoken hatred and disgust for Azerbaijanis , it seems that Baku \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning the population against their Christian neighbours , as illustrated by the case of Nurlan Ibrahimov , an official at the Azerbaijani football club Qarabag .\nOn social media , Ibrahimov published the following message : The UEFA investigated the official for potentially \u201c violating basic rules of decent conduct \u201d and banned him subsequently ( 26 November 2020 ) .\nThe next day , the Investigative Committee of the Republic of Armenia even issued a search warrant for the Azerbaijani football official , charging him with \u2018 inciting national , racial or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Criminal Code ) , inciting direct and public genocide ( Point 1 of the Part 2 of the Article 393.1 of RA Criminal Code ) , justifying and endorsing genocide and other crimes against peace and security of humanity ( Article 373.1 of RA Criminal Code ) .\n\u2019 Ibrahimov \u2019 s words are troubling , as they display unthinkable levels of hatred and disgust , and are nothing but a public call for the implementation of a genocidal policy beyond mere ethnic cleansing .\nThere are those who would say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement responds to a statement made by Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in the summer preceding the outbreak of the war : \u201c [ t ] his mission , whatever it might entail , which our ancestors [ meaning , the Ottomans ] have carried out for centuries in the Caucasus , we will continue to fulfill again \u201d ( 14 July 2020 ) .\nThe above-quoted Davidian , for instance , interprets \u201c Erdogan \u2019 s outburst [ as ] a reference to the Turkish genocide of the Armenians.\n\u201d After having spoken the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c age-old \u201d ties with the \u201c brother \u201d and \u201c friend \u201d Azerbaijan and Turkey \u2019 s moral duty to help and assist against unwarranted Armenian aggression .\nAt first sight , it would seem reasonable to assume that the Turkish President was effectively hinting at the events of the early 20th century , when the Ottomans were fighting alongside the Germans in the Great War ( 1914-18 ) and the promulgation of the \u2018 Deportation Act \u2019 ( Tehcir Kanunu ) on 24 April 1915 led to the massacre of untold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2018 First Genocide of 20th Century.\n\u2019 But when looking at the exact words used by Erdo\u011fan , one could arguably derive a somewhat different interpretation .\nThe Turkish President used the term \u2018 ecdadimiz \u2019 to refer to the Ottomans , a term that corresponds to ancestors , a term that has become quite popular in Turkey these days ( corresponding to the Arabic term \u2018 ajdad ) .\nHe did not talk about our \u2018 forefathers \u2019 or \u2018 grandfathers , \u2019 in which case he could have used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem logical when referring to people active in the early years of the previous century .\nMoreover , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan specifically spoke about a \u2018 mission \u2019 that had been \u2018 carried out for centuries.\n\u2018 Looking back at the historical circumstances in the past centuries , it seems hard to understand which \u201c mission \u201d Erdo\u011fan had in mind while talking about the Caucasus .\nIn Ottoman times , the Caucasus region primarily functioned as a buffer zone with the Safavids , ruling over the Iranian lands to the south .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became primarily an area of confrontation with the Russian Empire .\nFor the Ottomans , centred in \u0130stanbul , the Caucasus region was situated at the periphery of their world , beyond the Ottoman centre of gravity and the area that is now Azerbaijan really constituted the Ottoman Empire \u2019 s \u2018 near abroad , \u2019 to borrow a phrase more commonly used in connection with Russia .\nThe Ottoman mission the Prez was talking about seems to have had more to do with ensuring peace and non-hostile activity ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucasus than with eradicating Christians or Armenians .\nThe Prez did talk about \u2018 centuries \u2019 rather than \u2018 last century , \u2019 which would have been a time frame in line with the Armenian Genocide .\nFor , even though Ottomans and Safavids clashed regularly in the Southern Caucasus , trade and commercial exchanges were nevertheless very important and at times very vibrant between the Sunni and Shi \u2019 a power blocs of the Islamic world in the early modern period and beyond .\nThough he is a pious Muslim and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strategic terms , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is primarily a practical and pragmatic politician who wants to further his own or rather Turkey \u2019 s agenda .\nA news item carried by the Azebaijani private media outlet Trend News Agency on 30 November 2020 all but spells out one of the Prez \u2019 s ulterior motives for supporting the \u201c brotherly \u201d nation : \u201c Azerbaijan , Turkey plan MoU on natural gas transportation to Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic \u201d .\nRecently , Azerbaijan \u2019 s Minister of Energy Parviz Shahbazov told the press that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes of natural gas supplied from Azerbaijan to Turkey to Nakhchivan via the Igdir-Nakhchivan gas pipeline.\n\u201d In other words , the recent \u2018 liberation \u2019 of Nagorno-Karabakh will also turn out to be instrumental for Turkey as it pursues its longtime ambition of becoming an energy hub .\nTurkey \u2019 s active pipeline politics have already secured important links between both Turkic nations , with the recently completed Trans Adriatic Pipeline ( or TAP ) but the cherry on top of Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2018 s forays into Pipelineistan and the 2005-completed Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Ankara and Baku .\nNow that Azerbaijan has completed its takeover of land that was given up by Armenia as part of a Moscow-brokered peace deal at the beginning of this month , Azerbaijan \u2019 s strongman has told the world that this military and political \u201c victory opens a new era for our country .\nIt will be an era of development , security and progress.\n\u201d These three words \u2013 \u201c development , security and progress \u201d \u2013 are but music to Erdo\u011fan \u2018 s ears as he seemingly prepares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his Ottoman ancestors and sets out to secure the New Turkey \u2019 s near abroad in the Southern Caucasus and proceeds to mark the region with his very own pseudo-Ottoman stamp , as an equal partner of Russia \u2019 s Putin not quite knowing yet what to expect from the incoming \u201c Harris administration with Joe Biden as president \u201d of the United States .\n*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent historian and geo-political analyst who used to live in Istanbul .\nAt present , he is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide

\u2019 t sick .\nThe PCR test is merely picking up inactive ( noninfectious ) viral particles .\nIn one study,2 which looked at pregnant women admitted for delivery , 87.9 % of the women who tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 had no symptoms .\nAnother study3 looked at a large homeless shelter in Boston .\nAfter a cluster of COVID-19 cases was observed there , researchers conducted symptoms assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelter over a two-day period .\nOf 408 people tested , 147 , or 36 % , were positive , yet symptoms were conspicuously absent .\nCough occurred in only 7.5 % of cases , shortness of breath in 1.4 % and fever in 0.7 % .\nAll symptoms were \u201c uncommon among COVID-positive individuals , \u201d the researchers noted .\nDuring a June 8 , 2020 , press briefing , Maria Van Kerkhove , the World Health Organization \u2019 s technical lead for the COVID-19 pandemic , made it very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning an individual who tests positive but does not exhibit symptoms is highly unlikely to transmit live virus to others .\n\u201c We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing .\nThey \u2019 re following asymptomatic cases , they \u2019 re following contacts , and they \u2019 re not finding secondary transmission \u2026 it \u2019 s very rare , and much of that is not published in the literature , \u201d Van Kerkhove said .\nJust one day later , Dr. Mike Ryan , executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backpedaled Van Kerkhove \u2019 s statement , saying the remarks were \u201c misinterpreted.\n\u201d 4 Needless to say , when you \u2019 re trying to justify the implementation of a vast surveillance network , it \u2019 s no good to admit a vast majority of people are having their privacy infringed upon for no good reason whatsoever .\nAsymptomatic People Pose No Risk to Others Most recently , a study5 in Nature Communications assessed the risk posed by asymptomatic people by looking at the data from a mass screening program in Wuhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under strict lockdown between January 23 and April 8 , 2020 .\nBetween May 14 and June 1 , 2020 , 9,899,828 residents of Wuhan city over the age of 6 underwent PCR testing .\nIn all , 92.9 % of the entire city population participated in the testing .\nOf these , 9,865,404 had no previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and 34,424 were recovered COVID-19 patients .\nNot a single one of the 1,174 people who had been in close contact with an asymptomatic individual tested positive .\nIn all , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases detected .\n( The overall detection rate was 0.3 per 10,000 . )\nImportantly , not a single one of the 1,174 people who had been in close contact with an asymptomatic individual tested positive .\nAdditionally , of the 34,424 participants with a history of COVID-19 , 107 individuals ( 0.310 % ) tested positive again , but none were symptomatic .\nAs noted by the authors:6 \u201c Virus cultures were negative for all asymptomatic positive and repositive cases , indicating no \u2018 viable virus \u2019 in positive cases detected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons aged from 10 to 89 years \u2026 The asymptomatic positive rate was the lowest in children or adolescents aged 17 and below ( 0.124/10,000 ) , and the highest among the elderly aged 60 years and above ( 0.442/10,000 ) .\nThe asymptomatic positive rate in females ( 0.355/10,000 ) was higher than that in males ( 0.256/10,000 ) .\n\u201d Interestingly , when they further tested asymptomatic patients for antibodies , they discovered that 190 of the 300 , or 63.3 % , had actually had a \u201c hot \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies .\nStill , none of their contacts had been infected .\nIn other words , even though asymptomatics were ( or had been ) carriers of apparently live virus , they still did not transmit it to others .\nAs noted by the authors , \u201c there was no evidence of transmission from asymptomatic positive persons to traced close contacts.\n\u201d They further added:7 \u201c Compared with symptomatic patients , asymptomatic infected persons generally have low quantity of viral loads and a short duration of viral shedding , which decrease the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , virus culture was carried out on samples from asymptomatic positive cases , and found no viable SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nAll close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases tested negative , indicating that the asymptomatic positive cases detected in this study were unlikely to be infectious.\n\u201d Reinfected Individuals Are Not Infectious Either The same held true for people who tested positive a second time after having recovered from an active infection .\n\u201c Results of virus culturing and contract [ sic ] tracing found no evidence that repositive cases in recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with evidence from other sources , \u201d the authors said.8 The researchers also pointed out that virus cultures and genetic studies have shown the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be weakening over time , and that newly infected individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic and have a lower viral load than the cases seen earlier in the outbreak .\nWhat does all of this tell us ?\nIt tells us there \u2019 s no reason to panic simply because the number of positive tests are on the rise .\nRemember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCR test that is set to an excessive cycle threshold , the more false positives you \u2019 ll get .\nAs explained in \u201c Asymptomatic \u2018 Casedemic \u2019 Is a Perpetuation of Needless Fear , \u201d by using an excessive cycle threshold that amplifies the viral RNA to the point that it detects inactive ( noninfectious ) particles is at the heart of this so-called pandemic .\nIt \u2019 s what keeps the pandemic narrative going , when in fact it \u2019 s long since over .\nInterestingly , the same day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance9,10 on mask wearing , claiming asymptomatic people account for more than half of all transmissions .\nWhere did they get that from ?\nThe two references listed as support for that claim include a study11 from July 2020 , and CDC data that haven \u2019 t even been published yet.12 It just says it was \u201c submitted \u201d for publication sometime in 2020 , therefore , we are unable to provide any source link .\nThe CDC makes no mention of the China study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCNN , which reported the CDC \u2019 s update , parroting the idea that asymptomatic spread is why it \u2019 s so important to wear a mask , also made no mention of the landmark study from China .\nCurious , don \u2019 t you think ?\nIt \u2019 s almost as though the CDC doesn \u2019 t want us to know we have nothing to

concerns expressed by an increasing number of renowned scientists against the vaccine and the study design .\nOn the one hand , the petitioners demand that , due to the known lack of accuracy of the PCR test in a serious study , a so-called Sanger sequencing must be used .\nThis is the only way to make reliable statements on the effectiveness of a vaccine against Covid-19 .\nOn the basis of the many different PCR tests of highly varying quality , neither the risk of disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined with the necessary certainty , which is why testing the vaccine on humans is unethical per se .\nFurthermore , they demand that it must be excluded , e.g .\nby means of animal experiments , that risks already known from previous studies , which partly originate from the nature of the corona

immune reaction , especially when the test person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild \u201d virus after vaccination .\nThis so-called antibody-dependent amplification , ADE , has long been known from experiments with corona vaccines in cats , for example .\nIn the course of these studies all cats that initially tolerated the vaccination well died after catching the wild virus .\n\u2022 The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 .\nHowever , spike proteins also contain syncytin-homologous proteins , which are essential for the formation of the placenta in

.\n\u2022 The mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer contain polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) .\n70 % of people develop antibodies against this substance \u2013 this means that many people can develop allergic

substantial body of critical medical and scientific literature and information which should be made available to anyone prior to the administration of any drug or pharmaceutical product , especially if the product is a new or experimental technology .\nReaders should be aware that during the current mobilization effort to fast-track various products meant to treat COVID-19 , they should still exercise their right of informed consent recognized under international law and seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information pertaining to any possible long-term health risks associated these products .\nAccording to a study that examined how informed consent is given to COVID-19 vaccine trial participants , disclosure forms fail to inform volunteers that the vaccine might make them susceptible to more severe disease if they \u2019 re exposed to the virus .\nThe study,1 \u201c Informed Consent Disclosure to Vaccine Trial Subjects of Risk of COVID-19 Vaccine Worsening Clinical Disease , \u201d published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice , October 28 , 2020 , points out that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sensitize vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated.\n\u201d As noted by the authors of that International Journal of Clinical Practice paper , previous coronavirus vaccine efforts \u2014 for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) and respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) \u2014 have revealed a serious concern : The vaccines have a tendency to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement .\nWhat exactly does that mean ?\nIn a nutshell , it means that rather than enhance your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually enhances the virus \u2019 ability to enter and infect your cells , resulting in more severe disease than had you not been vaccinated.2 This is the exact opposite of what a vaccine is supposed to do , and a significant problem that has been pointed out from the very beginning of this push for a COVID-19 vaccine .\nThe 2003 review paper \u201c Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Virus Infection and Disease \u201d explains it this way:3 In my May 2020 interview above with Robert Kennedy Jr , he summarized the history of coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following three consecutive SARS outbreaks .\nBy 2012 , Chinese , American and European scientists were working on SARS vaccine development , and had about 30 promising candidates .\nOf those , the four best vaccine candidates were then given to ferrets , which are the closest analogue to human lung infections .\nIn the video below , which is a select outtake from my full interview , Kennedy explains what happened next .\nWhile the ferrets displayed robust antibody response , which is the metric used for vaccine licensing , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they all became severely ill and died .\nThe same thing happened when they tried to develop an RSV vaccine in the 1960s .\nRSV is an upper respiratory illness that is very similar to that caused by coronaviruses .\nAt that time , they had decided to skip animal trials and go directly to human trials .\nCoronaviruses produce not just one but two different types of antibodies : \u2022 Neutralizing antibodies,4 also referred to as immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibodies , that fight the infection \u2022 Binding antibodies5 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not prevent viral infection Instead of preventing viral infection , binding antibodies trigger an abnormal immune response known as \u201c paradoxical immune enhancement.\n\u201d Another way to look at this is your immune system is actually backfiring and not functioning to protect you but actually making you worse .\nMany of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in the running are using mRNA to instruct your cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ( S protein ) .\nThe spike protein , which is what attaches to the ACE2 receptor of the cell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process viruses use to gain entry into cells .\nThe idea is that by creating the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , your immune system will commence production of antibodies , without making you sick in the process .\nThe key question is , which of the two types of antibodies are being produced through this process ?\nIn an April 2020 Twitter thread,6 The Immunologist noted : \u201c While developing vaccines \u2026 and considering immunity passports , we must first understand the complex role of antibodies in SARS , MERS and COVID-19.\n\u201d He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies that have raised concerns about ADE .\nThe first is a 2017 study7 in PLOS Pathogens , \u201c Enhanced Inflammation in New Zealand White Rabbits When MERS-CoV Reinfection Occurs in the Absence of Neutralizing Antibody , \u201d which investigated whether getting infected with MERS would protect the subject against reinfection , as is typically the case with many viral illnesses .\n( Meaning , once you recover from a viral infection , say measles , you \u2019 re immune and won \u2019 t contract the illness again . )\nTo determine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers infected white rabbits with the virus .\nThe rabbits got sick and developed antibodies , but those antibodies were not the neutralizing kind , meaning the kind of antibodies that block infection .\nAs a result , they were not protected from reinfection , and when exposed to MERS for a second time , they became ill again , and more severely so .\n\u201c In fact , reinfection resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation , without an associated increase in viral RNA titers , \u201d the authors noted .\nInterestingly , neutralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preventing the animals from being infected a third time .\nAccording to the authors : In other words , if the vaccine does not result in a robust response in neutralizing antibodies , you might be at risk for more severe lung disease if you \u2019 re infected with the virus .\nAnd here \u2019 s an important point : COVID-19 vaccines are NOT designed to prevent infection .\nAs detailed in \u201c How COVID-19 Vaccine Trials Are Rigged , \u201d a \u201c successful \u201d vaccine merely needs to reduce the severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even looking at reducing infection , hospitalization or death rates .\nThe Dengue virus is also known to cause ADE .\nAs explained in a Swiss Medical Weekly paper published in April 2020:8 The paper goes on to detail results from follow-up investigations into the Dengue vaccine , which revealed the hospitalization rate for Dengue among vaccinated children under the age of 9 was greater than the rate among controls .\nThe explanation for this appears to be that the vaccine mimicked a primary infection , and as that immunity waned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they encountered the virus a second time .\nThe author explains : This could end up being important for the COVID-19 vaccine .\nHypothetically speaking , if SARS-CoV-2 works like Dengue , which is also caused by an RNA virus , then anyone who has not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 might actually be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 after vaccination , and only those who have already recovered from a bout of COVID-19 would be protected against severe illness by the vaccine .\nTo be clear , we do not know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these are important areas of inquiry and the current vaccine trials will simply not be able to answer this important question .\nThe Swiss Medical Weekly paper9 also reviews the evidence of ADE in coronavirus infections , citing research showing inoculating cats against the feline infectious peritonitis virus ( FIPV ) \u2014 a feline coronavirus \u2014 increases the severity of the disease when challenged with the same FIPV serotype as that in the vaccine .\nThe paper also cites research showing \u201c Antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine enhanced infection of B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hamster model.\n\u201d Another paper,10 \u201c Antibody-Dependent SARS Coronavirus Infection Is Mediated by Antibodies Against Spike Proteins , \u201d published in 2014 , found that : A study11 that ties into this was published in the journal JCI Insight in 2019 .\nHere , macaques vaccinated with a modified vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) virus encoding full-length SARS-CoV spike protein ended up with more severe lung pathology when the animals were exposed to the SARS virus .\nAnd , when they transferred anti-spike IgG antibodies into unvaccinated macaques , they developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c skewing the inflammation-resolving response.\n\u201d An interesting 2012 paper12 with the telling title , \u201c Immunization with SARS Coronavirus Vaccines Leads to Pulmonary Immunopathology on Challenge with the SARS Virus , \u201d demonstrates what many researchers now fear , namely that COVID-19 vaccines may end up making people more prone to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection .\nThe paper reviews experiments showing immunization with a variety of SARS vaccines resulted in pulmonary immunopathology once challenged with the SARS virus .\nAs noted by the authors:13 Inactivated whole virus vaccines whether inactivated with formalin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without alum adjuvant exhibited a Th2-type immunopathologic in lungs after challenge .\nAs indicated , two reports attributed the immunopathology to presence of the N protein in the vaccine ; however , we found the same immunopathologic reaction in animals given S protein vaccine only , although it appeared to be of lesser intensity .\nThus , a Th2-type immunopathologic reaction on challenge of vaccinated animals has occurred in three of four animal models ( not in hamsters ) including two different inbred mouse strains with four different types of SARS-CoV vaccines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine preparation that does not induce this result in mice , ferrets and nonhuman primates has not been reported .\nThis combined experience provides concern for trials with SARS-CoV vaccines in humans .\nClinical trials with SARS coronavirus vaccines have been conducted and reported to induce antibody responses and to be \u2018 safe.\n\u2019 However , the evidence for safety is for a short period of observation .\nThe concern arising from the present report is for an immunopathologic reaction occurring among vaccinated individuals on exposure to infectious SARS-CoV , the basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety concerns relate to effectiveness and safety against antigenic variants of SARS-CoV and for safety of vaccinated persons exposed to other coronaviruses , particularly those of the type 2 group.\n\u201d The Elderly Are Most Vulnerable to ADE On top of all of these concerns , there \u2019 s evidence showing the elderly \u2014 who are most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 \u2014 are also the most vulnerable to ADE .\nPreliminary research findings14 posted on the preprint server medRxiv at the end of March 2020 reported that middle-aged and elderly COVID-19 patients have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , again , increase infectivity \u2014 than younger patients .\nImmune Enhancement Is a Serious Concern Another paper worth mentioning is the May 2020 mini review15 \u201c Impact of Immune Enhancement on COVID-19 Polyclonal Hyperimmune Globulin Therapy and Vaccine Development.\n\u201d As in many other papers , the authors point out that:16 Currently , there are multiple SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates in pre-clinical or early phase clinical trials .\nAnimal studies on these CoVs have shown that the spike ( S ) protein-based vaccines ( specifically the receptor binding domain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against wild-type CoV challenge .\nVaccines that target other parts of the virus , such as the nucleocapsid , without the S protein , have shown no protection against CoV infection and increased lung pathology .\nHowever , immunization with some S protein based CoV vaccines have also displayed signs of enhanced lung pathology following challenge .\nHence , besides the choice of antigen target , vaccine efficacy and risk of immunopathology may be dependent on other ancillary factors , including adjuvant formulation , age at vaccination \u2026 and route of immunization.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Mind In all likelihood , regardless of how effective ( or ineffective ) the COVID-19 vaccines end up being , they \u2019 ll be released to the public in relatively short order .\nMost predict one or more vaccines will be ready sometime in 2021 .\nIronically , the data17,18,19 we now have no longer support a mass vaccination mandate , considering the lethality of COVID-19 is lower than the flu for those under the age of 60.20 If you \u2019 re under the age of 40 , your risk of dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning you have a 99.99 % chance of surviving the infection .\nAnd you could improve that to 99.999 % if you \u2019 re metabolically flexible and vitamin D replete .\nSo , really , what are we protecting against with a COVID-19 vaccine ?\nAs mentioned , the vaccines aren \u2019 t even designed to prevent infection , only reduce the severity of symptoms .\nMeanwhile , they could potentially make you sicker once you \u2019 re exposed to the virus .\nThat seems like a lot of risk for a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we started , participants in current COVID-19 vaccine trials are not being told of this risk \u2014 that by getting the vaccine they may end up with more severe COVID-19 once they \u2019 re infected with the virus .\nLethal Th2 Immunopathology Is Another Potential Risk In closing , consider what this PNAS news feature states about the risk of vaccine-induced immune enhancement and dysfunction , particularly for the elderly , the very people who would need the protection a vaccine might offer the most:21 \u2022 18 YouTube , SARS-CoV-2 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MD ,

Strains Means That \u2018Containing COVID-19 is Impossible\u2019", "content": "We now know that there are multiple strains of the \u2018 novel \u2019 Coronavirus , which may in part explain varying epidemiological outcomes in regions .\nThe New York Times recently reported that , in the early months of the pandemic , a particular genetic strain of Covid-19 known as D14G was shown to be more prevalent in Italy than any Asian countries .\nThis may have helped explain why the disease spread so fast in that country , and elsewhere in Europe and America .\nDavid Engelthaler has been investigating this idea .\nHis view is that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strain replicates faster than earlier strains , which \u201c likely \u201d came out of China and through to Europe .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really quickly dominated all of the other strains that were seen in Europe at the time , it became the predominant strain that came into the Americas , spread throughout the United States and is now spread to pretty much every corner of the planet \u201d .\nIn his own state of Arizona , Engelthaler witnessed several of the early introductions to Arizona , coming from the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out quickly , with less effective transmission .\n\u201c And then all of a sudden we started having explosive outbreaks .\nWhen we go back and look genomically , the vast majority of those cases where we had very large outbreaks were being driven by the strains that were coming from the East Coast out of Europe , which all seemed to have this particular mutation in the spike protein.\n\u201d This doesn \u2019 t mean that the mutation is more deadly , simply that it may be more faster at transmitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our arms around the virus \u201d .\nAs such , Engelthaler argues that trying to eliminate the virus was not the right approach and instead we should have been trying to slow its spread : \u201c What we \u2019 re really seeing is a SARS-like infection that spreads like the common cold .\nAnd with there \u2019 s no way that we could put in mitigation strategies to stop the common cold \u201d .\nSo were uniform national lockdowns the right solution with this newer mutation that potentially spread more effectively ?\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just been devastating in a way that we haven \u2019 t even properly appropriately characterised yet \u201d .\nHe says that the \u201c vast majority \u201d of at-risk people \u201c could have been prevented if the focus was on protecting them , rather than on trying to prevent any spread of this virus , which is pretty much is un-containable \u201d .\nEngelthaler is also one of the few epidemiologists to have publicly spoken out against school closures , for which there is \u201c no scientific evidence \u201d .\n\u201c Privately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely been a lot of discussion from the very beginning that there \u2019 s no scientific evidence that shutting down schools actually helps to stop a pandemic\u2026 Epidemiologists knew that from the beginning , but that was not a popular opinion to take publicly and seems to have been kind of left to the side \u201d .\nUltimately , Engelthaler believes that human agency in the midst of a pandemic has been over-emphasised : \u201c I do think that one thing that does seem to get lost in all of this is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this pandemic , and it \u2019 s the virus , it \u2019 s not just people \u2019 s policies and people \u2019 s behaviours \u201d .\nThat is especially true when there are \u201c different strains that are acting differently in different parts of the world , leading to different outcomes , at least in some part because of that virus , not just based off of public policies in response , no matter what you do

making that impossible trip on Christmas Eve to deliver presents and cheer to wide-eyed younglings around the world .\nIn 2020 , Government has sought to muscle-in on the marketplace of myths with a competing set of fables of its own , suitable for adults and children alike .\nEver since March , the Government , in conjunction with its media partners , has erected a god-inspiring pandemic PR machine which is now in full-spin mode over the holiday season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new weekly plot twists .\nand harrowing stories of \u2018 new strains \u2019 of the no longer novel coronavirus \u2013 prompting bombastic calls to \u2018 Cancel Christmas \u2018 and throw the nation into a third lockdown .\nThis , supposedly to save lives and to \u2018 protect the NHS.\n\u2019 But how many of these claims by persons in positions of authority are true , and how many are contrived ?\nJust as when mum and dad have to break it to the kids that Santa is just a children \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we finally level with the public and reveal that underpinning this Christmas folly are nothing more than a fanciful woven basket of assumptions and myths .\nThey are : \u2022 \u2018 The ICUs are overrun , we \u2019 re running out of hospitals beds !\n\u2019 \u2022 \u2018 A new mutant strain is on the loose , and it \u2019 s 70 percent more contagious !\n\u2019 \u2022 The \u2018 R number \u2019 is above one !\nAs it turns out , each of these widely-held assumptions are about as real as Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable adults in the room , this Christmas pantomime looks set to continue .\nThere is No Hospital Crisis For months , the mainstream media have allowed government ministers like Matt Hancock and Jonathan Van-Tam to promulgate the idea that there \u2019 s a deadly pandemic which is still raging through the country , and that the number of COVID patients is approaching equal levels to the peak last April .\nWe must lockdown now in order to Save the NHS\u2122 , or so the narrative goes .\nHowever , upon examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such hysterical claims favoured by tabloid headline writers and BBC anchors do not even remotely resemble reality .\nAccording to a recent report , the UK \u2019 s NHS data clearly shows that the country \u2019 s hospitals are in fact quieter than this time last year .\nTherefore , any suggestions by UK government ministers and officials that hospitals are \u2018 overrun by COVID patients \u2019 is simply false .\nSome key data points from that report : \u2022 Average intensive care ward occupancy down to 75 per cent from 84 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year \u2022 15,465 people in hospital with Covid in England on Wednesday compared to 18,974 on worst day in spring \u2022 But statistics suggest the health service is , overall , coping better with its workload than it did last winter The Mail Online report goes on to state that , \u201c statistics suggest the health service is , overall , coping better with its workload than it did last winter .\nA greater proportion of ward beds are free , intensive care units have more room and A & E departments aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often than usual \u2013 with the exception of a bad day at one NHS trust in the Midlands .\nAnd the occupancy figure does not take into account bolstered capacity at the mothballed Nightingale hospitals , which went unused after being built during the first wave in case wards were overrun with Covid , or the thousands of additional beds commandeered from the private sector for the same purpose.\n\u201d In other words , there is no ICU or hospital crisis in Britain \u2013 to suggest there ever was one is patently false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been incessantly pushed by government officials and repeated by their loyal allied media machine .\nThis bucket of cold water won \u2019 t stop the mainstream media and 77th Brigade trolls online from presenting an endless stream of emotive and anecdotal stories from supposed \u201c frontline healthcare \u201d combatants , all claiming the NHS is a war zone and we must all be good patriots and get behind the war effort , and honour the dead by doing our part ; social distancing , masks , stay off the streets , and whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NHS unless you are on death \u2019 s door , and so on .\nIt all sounds eerily familiar .\nThe hospital bed myth is one of the main creaky pillars of Project Fear .\nThat \u2019 s not to say it isn \u2019 t possible should a real pandemic might arrive on day and \u2018 rage \u2019 through the population , but to date this simply hasn \u2019 t been the case .\nAnyone who has honestly and soberly reviewed the official data sets has known this since last spring .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to cancel Christmas is the latest sensational claim that there \u2019 s a new mutant strain of the Rona on the loose which is supposedly \u201c 70 % more contagious , \u201d and which is ripping through the unsuspecting villages and hamlets in south of England as we speak .\nCommon sense would dictate that officials could not have possibly been able to verify such a claim in the span of only a few week , an obvious point which media mavens haven \u2019 t managed to challenge the government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the back of this widely reported \u2018 scientific \u2019 assumption , multiple European countries panicked and closed their borders to UK travelers .\nThe insanity has also made it across the Atlantic , with lockdown-loving New York Governor Andrew Cuomo decreeing over the weekend that it was \u201c reprehensible \u201d and \u201c grossly negligent \u201d to allow any travelers from Britain to fly into his private fiefdom at New York \u2019 s JFK Airport without being tested for coronavirus .\nCuomo , well-accustomed to grandstanding over COVID , stated , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK is getting on a plane and flying to JFK.\n\u201d Cooler heads have already urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to please publish the actual evidence in the government \u2019 s data which justifies canceling Christmas and New Years festivities .\nThus far he hasn \u2019 t done so .\nAnd its little surprise why : the government has no such data .\nRenowned epidemiologist Carl Heneghan , Professor of Evidence Based Medicine in Oxford University , has raised serious doubts over the government \u2019 s \u201c 70 % \u201d claim .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 25 years and I can tell you can \u2019 t establish a quantifiable number in such a short time frame , \u201d said Heneghan .\n\u201c They are fitting the data to the evidence .\nThey see cases rising and they are looking for evidence to explain it.\n\u201d \u201c It has massive implications , it \u2019 s causing fear and panic , but we should not be in this situation when the Government is putting out data that is unquantifiable , \u201d he added .\nOf course , Heneghan is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wrong .\nThat \u2019 s been the story throughout .\nAs it turns out , the source of government \u2019 s latest wild \u201c 70 % \u201d claims may have come from some of the usual suspects already implicated as bad actors in this entire pandemic debacle .\nIncredibly , one of those characters is none other than Professor Neil Ferguson , author of the original science fiction modelling which helped to drive both the UK and US governments into lockdown back in March .\nEven after that epic failure , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing him to pollute their NERVTAG ( New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group ) committee with his malign influence .\nThe latest exotic guesswork behind the \u201c 70 % more transmissible \u201d claim seems to be the result of more dodgy computer-modelling claims .\nMore viral WMDs .\nNaturally , this low hanging fruit was seized upon by Chris Whitty , the government \u2019 s in-house corporate pharmaceutical sales rep who moonlights as Chief Medical Officer , who brought it straight to the attention of Prime Minister Boris Johnson .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon in a recent interview , describing this pseudo-scientific folly as that of a \u201c government is obsessed with a crisis more or less invented out of statistics.\n\u201d Since the crisis began , Government science advisors at SAGE have invented a number of arbitrary mechanisms which politicians have been cherry-picking from in order to justify their own \u2018 raging pandemic \u2019 narratives .\nOne of those is the ever-illusive \u201c R number \u201d \u2013 something which did not actually exist in real science until Government fashioned it together in March 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept R-0 ( R naught ) which is meant to represent a theoretical \u2018 reproduction \u2019 or transmission rate at large among the populace .\nThe reason the government has reinvented this metric is so that it can be applied theoretically and arbitrarily at will in order to generate the result which its technocrats want .\nNote the loose sliding scale being applied as stated in the Daily Mail this week : \u201c In more confirmation that No10 is struggling to keep a lid on the epidemic , SAGE today claimed Britain \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now definitely above one again .\nThe R is the average number of people each Covid patient infects and when it \u2019 s above one it means cases are growing exponentially.\n\u201d In reality , there is no way the government can actually measure their \u201c R number \u201d accurately and in real time , but the media seem disinterested in taking them to task on this bit of scientism .\nWhen government claims that , \u201c when it \u2019 s above one it means cases are growing exponentially \u201d \u2013 know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no way predicts exponential growth .\nAny epidemiologist who is not on the government \u2019 s payroll will tell you that this notion is pure pseudo-science .\nFirstly , these tall tales of eternal geometric growth of the virus ignore the prevalence-suppressing realities of herd immunity and T-cell immunity , not to mention the fact that when the virus mutates it tends to get weaker , not stronger .\nWhat they also aren \u2019 t telling you is the real cornerstone holding up this entire facade , namely that the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate their theoretic \u201c R number \u201d is coming from the highly problematic PCR Test \u2013 which means their \u201c R number \u201d is not worth the paper its written on .\nWriter Jeffrey Peel explains the nub of the issue in his recent piece , explaining that , \u201c the PCR test is a duff test .\nI \u2019 m not going to re-hash a huge volume of work and back catalogue of research .\nThere are a lot of resources on www.pcrclaims.co.uk that justify the view that the testing is creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 when they are , in fact , simply false positives .\nThe PCR test produces large volumes of false positives simply because it is not fit for purpose for testing large populations of asymptomatic people.\n\u201d Similarly , claims of a \u201c new more infectious mutant strain of coronavirus \u201d are being used to advance the myth of the \u2018 asymptomatic spreader.\n\u2019 This is no trivial item either \u2013 the myth of the invisible \u201c asymptomatic super-spreader \u201d phantom menace is the cornerstone of every single reactionary pandemic policy of 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social distancing , masks , school closures , and vaccines \u2013 are all predicated on the widely held false claim of the \u2018 asymptomatic spreader.\n\u2019 The data clearly demonstrates that this was a monumental lie from the very beginning of the COVID crisis .\nTo date , the most state-of-the-art science on asymptomatic spreading actually comes from Wuhan in China , where 300 subjects were followed and monitored over the entirety of their incubation period only to find almost zero cases of asymptomatic spreading .\nIn fact , globally authorities can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible asymptomatic spreading , as reported by Lockdown Skeptics : \u201c The existence of transmission of SCoV2 from asymptomatic individuals has become an accepted truth but\u2026examination of the underlying data from the most frequently-cited reveals that the conclusions are based on a surprisingly small number of cases ( six in total globally ) .\n\u201d Just to reiterate , that means all of these supposed mitigation policies being pursued by hypochondria-inspired governments should be null and void .\nNow after all that , you \u2019 re probably thinking \u2013 if it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ?\nThe answer is pretty unremarkable , and might disappoint some folks : it \u2019 s just another winter , like the last one , and the one before that .\nIt should be anyway , but the Government and Media have another parallel reality they are forever constructing .\nThis entire pandemic drama has been a case of one lie piled on top of another , and another , and another .\nRather than admit they got it completely wrong , Government operatives have instead doubled-down .\nBut these craven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the reality that their entire contrived COVID crisis is one giant house of cards which has already collapsed , only the majority of the mainstream media gatekeepers haven \u2019 t realised it yet .\n*** Author Patrick Henningsen is an American writer and global affairs analyst and founder of independent news and analysis site 21st Century Wire , and

propped-up by their partnering governments and their corporate media syndicate \u2013 have unleashed a torrent of high-level public relations and marketing for their brand new experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine \u2013 in the hopes of fast-tracking the controversial product \u2019 s approval .\nTheir effort to sidestep normal safety and testing protocols appears to have worked \u2013 compressing what would normally be a 4 to 10 year process of animal testing , observation , retesting , human testing , reviewing , and follow-ups \u2013 into a new hyper-active \u2018 warp speed \u2019 journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recklessness of the industry and government has shocked many leading professionals in the field .\nWhile politicians and the media have chosen to turn away and ignore these crucial concerns over this unprecedented \u2018 fast-tracked \u2019 vaccine product , a few ethical professionals have been brave enough speak out and campaign for accountability on the issue .\nHowever , despite their success in garnering a substantial constituency of international support , government authorities and industry regulators are still hiding behind a wall of denial , refusing to acknowledge any requests for communication from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulmonologist and former head of a public health department , and Dr. Michael Yeadon , ex-Pfizer research director for respiratory diseases , petitioned the EMA , the European Medicines Agency , on December 1 , 2020 , to immediately stop clinical trials of the Corona vaccines .\nThe petition has been supported by at least 80,000 people and can be further supported .\nThe flood of emails from concerned supporters was so high so that during the peaks the EMA \u2019 s server was temporarily unavailable .\nNevertheless , as of December 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , no comment from the EMA on the petitioners \u2019 submission .\nAs 2020News has learned , on December 10 , 2020 , at least one of the petitioners requested to Harald Enzmann ( [ email protected ] ) , Chair of EMA \u2019 s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) , that the agenda for the live EMA hearing on Corona vaccines scheduled today , December 11 , 2020 , from 1 \u2013 4 p.m. ( 2020News will report ) be changed to include discussion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s and Dr. Yedaon \u2019 s request .\nIn response to the petitioner \u2019 s email , only Ms. Irene Bachmann ( [ email protected ] ) , acting as Mr. Enzmann \u2019 s absentee deputy , responded , stating in substance that it was assumed that the EMA would get back to the petitioners in this matter .\n2020News would like to encourage its readers to ask the persons involved at EMA to what extent the aspects discussed in the petition have found their way into the public and internal discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As 2020News has learned , the petition has not yet been brought to the attention of the relevant staff of the entities responsible for deciding on vaccine approval at the national level \u2013 in Germany , for example , the Paul Ehrlich Institute .\nIt is unclear why the EMA has not sought dialogue regarding the concerns raised with the institutes of the EU member states .\nDr. Wordarg and Dr. Yeadon see major vaccine threats to the population .\nThey point to the extremely short period of clinical trials : vaccines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months of human clinical trials , whereas in the normal course it takes five to ten years for a vaccine to undergo all safety testing .\nThere are significant concerns about the possible occurrence of an exuberant immune response , which , for example , had led to the death of all cats in a Corona vaccine under development for cats .\nIn addition , there are fears that the vaccine could render women infertile because it can trigger antibodies that can then attack not only the Corona viruses but also special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viruses and essential for the formation of a placenta .\nThese dangers can not be ruled out due to the extremely shortened observation period , which , the petitioners told 2020News , is not compatible with the European precautionary principle .\nIn the EU , the precautionary principle applies , among other things , to drug approval .\nA product is only approved in the EU if its harmlessness is essentially proven .\nThis corresponds to the comparatively low level of compensation for physical damage suffered .\nIf you can no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a heart medication , you will receive a maximum of about \u20ac100,000 in compensation for the loss of enjoyment of life from the pharmaceutical company that caused the damage , if you win your lawsuit .\nIn addition , the injuring party must pay for material resources and costs for caregivers who have become necessary due to the injurious event .\nIn the USA , the precautionary principle does not apply .\nHere , the regulations regarding potentially hazardous products are much more manufacturer-friendly .\nMarket approval is only denied to products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been proven .\nHowever , injured persons in the USA receive incomparably higher compensation payments .\nIn the case of a paralyzed arm , compensation payments of several million US dollars may be due in the USA .\nThe fear of high compensation claims is a similarly effective deterrent in the USA as the precautionary principle is in Europe .\nThe TTIP , CETA , etc .\ntrade agreements were intended to override the precautionary principle for Europe in favor of companies , but without changing the compensation rules .\nThey would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both worlds : low barriers to market entry with little risk of being obliged to pay damaged from harmful products .\nTTIP did not come about , but CETA entered into force , at least provisionally , under pressure from lobbyists .\nThe similarly structured free trade agreement with Japan ( JEFTA ) has been concluded .\nIt remains to be seen to what extent these agreements will play a role in the Corona and lockdown events .\nHowever , vaccinations are already a very low-risk proposition in both the U.S. and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shifted to the state in both legal systems .\nAccordingly , from an economic point of view , vaccine manufacturers have little reason to invest particularly heavily in studies or to refrain from marketing a potentially toxic vaccine .\nIt is the responsibility of the government authorities to prevent damage to the population by careful examination and the prevention of undesirable influence on the authorities called upon to make decisions .\nIn the USA , the Emergency Preparedness and Response Act ( PREP ) applies in the event of damage caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vaccines that , like the Corona vaccines , are marketed under emergency use authorizations .\nThis could result in a complete exemption from liability for the manufacturing companies .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR WINTER

House in 2016 \u2013 Clinton receiving 65,853,625 votes ( 48.0 % ) and Trump , 62,985,106 votes ( 45.9 % ) , leading to the latter \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral votes .\nThe real meaning of this odd numbers \u2019 configuration is that Donald Trump was able to appeal to more individual states \u2019 populations than his rival , which means that his message clearly had a wider geographic reach and appeal .\nMAGA : The Return of the American Dream In the aftermath of the Trump victory , the book Identity Crisis : The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America tried

feelings of race hatred constitute one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to emerge on the political scene and capture the Electoral College .\nRecently , the American writer , professor , and social

widely held verdict on the political Left and mainstream media regarding the the persona of the 45th U.S. President .\nAnd one could reason that this perceived undertow of racism appeals to wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swathes across a wide geographical spectrum of the United States .\nAccording to popular vote numbers , Clinton had clearly been victorious , but Trump \u2019 s lower figures represented a wider geographic reach , thereby arguably reflecting more accurately the will of the people in the whole of the nation , rather than expressing the volition of the inhabitants of a number of certain more populous ( and Clinton-leaning ) states .\nThe real-estate-developer-turned-political-leader \u2019 s journey to the White House started in the summer of 2015 .\nOn 16 June 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s road to the White House started on an escalator \u201d in the Trump Tower , going down to make this announcement to the world : And that was how The Donald ( as he was called by his first wife Ivana ) or the Drumpf ( in reference to his grandfather Friedrich Drumpf who came to the United States in 1885 ) started his long and arduous trek to Pennsylvania Avenue , a journey many thought impossible or merely counter-intuitive .\nAt first sight , it might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirms that the issues of race and racism are really at the heart of political and public life in the U.S. , as seems to be the message of such popular movements like Black Lives Matter and its now all-encompassing ideology of Critical Race Theory .\nBut Trump has clearly also tapped into the wider population \u2019 s belief systems and mythological vocabulary , as exemplified in the phrase of the American Dream .\nThis ubiquitous phrase stems from the pen of the popular historian James Truslow Adams ( 1878-1949 ) and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The candidate Trump promised to revive that defunct ideal , which primarily found expression in the advertising phrase \u2018 Make America Great Again \u2019 or MAGA , emblazoned upon innumerable hats on top of numerous Americans \u2019 heads \u2013 arguably leading to profitable sales figures of \u2018 official MAGA hats .\nThe only place you can buy the official hat is at the Trump Store.\n\u2019 The mere fact that Trump \u2019 s running mate-turned-vice president was clearly chosen to appeal to the religious right seems to underline the importance of Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives .\nThe sociologist Dr Philip Gorski , for instance , quite self-assuredly posits that \u201c Trump \u2019 s most loyal supporters were and are white evangelicals.\n\u201d Religion in the Trump Era : Speeding up the Rapture The past four years have seen a sudden resurgence of religion in the United States on a political level .\nIn his \u2018 folksy Midwestern drawl , \u2019 Trump \u2019 s Vice President , Mike Pence makes no bones about his personal bond with the good lord up above and his son , Jesus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Anderson , in his home state Indiana , the VP finished his pep talk in this way : \u201c It \u2019 s a good time to pray for America .\n.\n.\nIf His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray , He \u2019 ll hear from heaven , and He \u2019 ll heal this land !\n\u201d Born into a Catholic family , Pence discovered his personal Jesus when he was in college , attending a \u201c contemporary Christian music festival.\n\u201d Sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2017 , Pence told the crowd his personal conversion story : From that day forward , the one-time Catholic boy became a fervent Evangelical Christian , eager to please his Lord and keen to convert his fellow man .\nIt thus seems safe to say that Pence \u2019 s example persuaded \u201c fully eight-in-ten self-identified white , born-again/evangelical Christians \u201d to cast their vote for Trump in 2016 , as indicated by the Pew Research Center .\nBut not just the Vice President is eager to profess his faith , Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally keen .\nIn October 2019 , Pompeo addressed the American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville , Tennessee , with a speech insightfully entitled \u201c Being a Christian Leader.\n\u201d Trump \u2019 s close ties to Bibi , in combination with these two Christian leaders under his wing , have already made the White House move the U.S. Embassy to Israel to Jerusalem , in a theologically significant manner that Trump \u2019 s Evangelical base likely regards as the first step towards fulfilling God \u2019 s plan , as I explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the now U.S. Secretary of State adheres to even more outrageous points of faith .\nIn June 2015 , when Pompeo was but a Kansas congressman , he headlined a so-called \u2018 God and Country Rally \u2019 at Wichita \u2019 s Summit Church and there and then , Pompeo made this profession of faith : In fact , for Christian believers like Pence and Pompeo , \u201c returning Jerusalem to the Jewish people is a key to the second coming of Christ , \u201d which is also a prerequisite for the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the above quotation .\nThe pastor , Dr Richard Mayhue elucidates that the \u201c English noun/verb \u2018 rapture \u2019 comes from the Latin noun raptura/verb rapio that is used 14 times in the \u201d New Testament .\nAnd though the noun and verb have different meanings and connotations , it is the \u201c perfect word to describe God suddenly taking up the church from earth to heaven as the first part of Christ \u2019 s second coming , \u201d adds Mayhue .\nBelievers like Pompeo , sometimes known as millenarianists , adhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world to be imminent and the return of Jesus within reach .\nThat return will be followed by the establishment of a Divine Kingdom on earth , but before \u201c He establishes His kingdom on earth , Jesus will come for His Church , an event commonly referred to as the \u2018 Rapture.\n\u2019 At that time the dead in Christ will be raised and living Christians will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air and be with Him forever , \u201d as explained on a website emanating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago-based fundamentalist Christian institution of higher education established in 1886 .\nThese admittedly rather outlandish beliefs rely on the Bible , or rather on a literalist interpretation of scripture , as a reflection of the inerrancy of the Bible .\nAs expressed by the one-time Rapture enthusiast Harold Camping ( 1921-2013 ) , the \u201c Bible is God \u2019 s word .\nIn the original languages of the Bible , mainly Hebrew and Greek , every word , and every letter of every word , is from the mouth of God.\n\u201d This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to an article published in the Princeton Review on 11 April 1881 .\nThe piece is called \u201c Inspiration \u201d and was written by Archibald A. Hodge ( 1823-86 ) and Benjamin Warfield ( 1851-1921 ) .\nHodge and Warfield claim that the \u201c scriptures not only contain , but ARE THE WORD OF GOD , and hence that all their elements and all their affirmations are absolutely errorless , and binding the faith and obedience of men.\n\u201d They thus put forward that \u201c God [ had been ] co\u00f6perating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Scripture.\n\u201d And that really means that the Trump White House has been conducting important parts of its foreign policy in accordance with very specific interpretations of particular Biblical precepts and judgements .\nOr , otherwise put , the real-estate-developer-turned-political-leader that is Trump has supervised Christian leaders to enact policy decisions they deem to be a direct reflection of the word of God .\nWhen Trump controversially visited St. John \u2019 s Church across the park from the White House on 2 June 2020 , using \u201c the federal force \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resultant photo-op had him not coincidentally pose with a Bible in his hand .\nThe picture was clearly aimed at his Evangelical base , showing them that his guidance came from the inerrant Holy Scripture , defying Black Lives Matter protesters .\nA shocked world has now lived through four years of a Trump White House and is presently breathing a collective sigh of relief : \u201c World leaders have acknowledged \u2014 and even celebrated \u2014 the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in the 2020 United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unabashedly anti-Trump public-yet-corporate-sponsored American broadcaster NPR on 7 November 2020 .\nThis year \u2019 s election outcome had Biden gather no less than 81,283,098 votes ( 51.3 % or 306 electoral votes ) and Trump , 74,222,957 ( 46.8 % or 232 electoral votes ) .\nAs a result of this year \u2019 s special circumstances , many , supposedly Democratic leaning , voters opted for postal ballots , rather than casting their votes in person .\nHence the delayed outcome , victorious Democrats say .\nBut , Trump and his supporters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\ninstead , they are crying foul loudly and have urged recount upon recount .\nThe news broadcaster CNN , exquisite purveyor of Fake News , in Trump \u2019 s words , \u201c reports that Trump not only insists he actually won the 2020 election but has maintained at times that he will not vacate the premises on January 20 , when his term ends.\n\u201d In contract , the U.S. media and a good part of the American population hold that Joe Biden won this year \u2019 s electoral contest and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House .\nAnd that means that his VP will join him , a black woman of mixed Indian-Jamaican-American descent , Kamala Harris .\nBut that is still for next year , following the inauguration and the peaceful handover .\nThe fact that the Biden team picked a non-white woman for the job was a deliberate decision , a decision reflecting the prevailing mood in the country .\nThe United States , ( and parts of the rest of the world as well , ) are currently totally in the grip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideology most people currently call \u2018 Social Justice \u2019 and its derivative popular outgrowth known as Woke culture .\nPresident-elect Biden is getting ready to replace Bible-beholden Trump and become a Woke president adhering to current ideological fashions and catch phrases .\nGoing back to 1977 and the publication of The Combahee River Collective Statement , the concept of identity politics is ubiquitous these days , which means that now \u201c everything is about race , \u201d as claimed by Ted G. Waechter in 2016 .\nActing accordingly , the President-elect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethnic and/or sexual minorities to fill the spots : \u201c We \u2019 ll have more people of color than any Cabinet ever .\nWe \u2019 ll have more women than any Cabinet ever .\nWe \u2019 ll have a Cabinet of barrier-breakers .\nA Cabinet of firsts \u201d ( 16 December 2020 ) .\nUnder Biden , America \u2019 s war machine will be operated by a black man , Lloyd Austin , while U.S. trade representation will be handled by the \u201c first woman of color and first Asian American to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe position of Secretary of the Interior will be filled by Deb Haaland , a New Mexico native and member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe .\nAnd , \u201c Joe Biden will [ also ] nominate Pete Buttigieg to be his transportation secretary , \u201d turning his erstwhile presidential rival into the \u201c first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ Cabinet secretary.\n\u201d In this way , it is apparently expected that the appearance of the rulers of United States will more or less coincide with the actual make up of the bulk of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a large extent dominated by the Christian Bible and various resultant outlandish beliefs , the next four years seem set to be adhering to a secular religion of sorts , namely to the ideological construct usually referred to as Critical Social Justice \u2013 which is a concept that \u201c recognizes inequality as deeply embedded in the fabric of society ( i.e.\n, as structural ) , and actively seeks to change this , \u201d as postulated by \u00d6zlem \u015eensoy and Robin DiAngelo in their seminal 2012 book , Is Everyone Really Equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up the Bible , Biden is now clearly paying lip service to Black Lives Matter protesters and their many sympathizers in society at large \u2013 in this way .\nshowing himself to be Woke-in-Chief in spite of his advanced years .\nAs such , \u015eensoy and DiAngelo \u2019 s seminal text and the whole Critical Social Justice ideology have proven that ostentatiously secular constructs can also lead the way towards espousing blatantly outlandish beliefs .\nTaking the whole race discourse to its logical conclusion two black women , the real estate agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renee Walters have founded the Freedom Georgia Initiative , as a means to fulfill a mission of \u2018 Healing From Racial Trauma.\n\u2019 The project consists of 19 Black families who have collectively purchased 96.71 acres of rural land in Toomsboro , Georgia .\nThe aim is to develop a \u2018 self-contained Black community , \u2019 as a town of a few hundred people .\nIn other words , in order to overcome racism , this Initiative has effectively set up a segregated community where whites are not welcome as a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black families.\n\u201d Whereas , the world of academia these days is in thrall of the unholy trinity of diversity , equity , and inclusion ( DEI ) and an academic like Dr Ibram X. Kendi propagates the idea that the \u201c opposite of \u2018 racist \u2019 isn \u2019 t \u2018 not racist.\n\u2019 It is \u2018 anti-racist \u2019 , \u201d which sounds as logical and counter-intuitive as instituting segregation to combat racism and discrimination .\nBiden clearly won \u2019 t be holding a Bible in his hand , but will instead have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose from in order to be able to put the right words in his mouth while addressing his voters and their expectations .\nAt the same time , many people also express the hope that the Bidens in the White House will restore a sense of normality to the U.S. and its political life .\nIran \u2019 s President Rouhani , for his part , seemed to give voice to such an opinion when he said that \u201c [ w ] e are not overjoyed about Mr. Biden \u2019 s arrival , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d as reported by EHA News .\nBut Biden \u2019 s first task will be to tackle COVID-19 .\nThe Presdent-elect himself has come out saying that \u201c [ d ] ealing with the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most important battles our administration will face.\n\u201d Yet remaining realistic , also declaring that the \u201c end of the battle against COVID-19 is still months away.\n\u201d In his published plans to combat the health crisis , Biden recognizes the need to bring an end to the economic fallout produced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put in place .\nThe Biden Plan calls for a \u201c decisive economic response that starts with emergency paid leave for all those affected by the outbreak and gives all necessary help to workers , families , and small businesses that are hit hard by this crisis.\n\u201d Many blame Trump for the Covid fatalities in the U.S. and Biden wants to show himself as the leader who beat the virus and restored the nation to health .\nBut more than anything else , a Biden presidency aims to be a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means continuity and not change , whatever the colour may be .\nPresident Obama continued George W. Bush \u2019 s war policies , with the former overseeing more drone strikes in his first year in the White House than the latter carried out during his entire 8-year presidency .\nAnd , Trump , in turn

"COVID-19: The Emergence of the Pandemic Industrial Complex", "content": "If official numbers are to be believed , the United States is one of the worst hit countries in terms of COVID-19 infections and deaths .\nAccording to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , at the time of writing , there are supposedly 19 million COVID-19 cases with an alleged 300,000+ deaths suggesting between a 1-2 % chance of dying from COVID-19 if infected by it .\nHowever , these numbers are problematic \u2013 even before questioning the validity of the statistics themselves leading to them .\nFor example \u2013 asymptomatic cases will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more people are actually being infected by COVID-19 , exhibiting no symptoms , receiving no treatment , and most certainly not making it into the CDC \u2019 s \u201c cases \u201d statistics .\nThis means that your chances of being infected by COVID-19 and dying are actually much , much less than the often touted claim of 1-2 % .\nOnly those who exhibit severe enough symptoms to be tested and/or treated will make it into the statistics of \u201c cases.\n\u201d In terms of framing any pandemic , an exaggeration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental issue .\nIf this information by itself is carelessly or dishonestly presented to the public without mention of the many more people likely being infected and exhibiting no symptoms at all , panic can , and clearly has been spread across society and the world , enabling extreme policies to glide through approval , beginning the process of disfigurement society now suffers today .\nThis was a fact highlighted by the work of Dr. John Ioannidis who , even at the onset of COVID-19 , attempted to raise the alarm about needlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving public health policy without proper data , and the catastrophic impact it would have \u2013 and is now clearly having \u2013 on society if this trend isn \u2019 t reversed .\nA video interview conducted by Journeyman Pictures from April 2020 noted Dr. Ioannidis \u2019 breakdown of data and the results of his own studies conducted to illustrate exactly this .\nHis study included widespread serological ( antibody ) testing in Santa Clara County , California to see how many individuals may have been infected by COVID-19 but simply never exhibited symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical attention and be tested for COVID-19 .\n\u201c If you compare the numbers that we estimate to have been infected , which vary from 48,000-81,000 , versus the number of documented cases that would correspond to the same time horizon around April 1st , when we had 956 cases documented in Santa Clara County , we realize that the number of infected people is somewhere between 50 and 85 times more compared to what we thought , compared to what had been documented .\nImmediately , that means that the infection fatality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability of dying , if you are infected , diminishes by 50-85 fold , because the denominator in the calculation becomes 50-85 fold bigger .\nIf you take these numbers into account , they suggest that the infection fatality rate for this new coronavirus is likely to be in the same ballpark as seasonal influenza.\n\u201d Dr. Ioannidis also noted that there was a large gradient regarding death rates based on age and underlying medical conditions , with the risk of death for people under 65 with no underlying medical conditions being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing to fully establish mature datasets \u2013 as Dr. Ioannidis and his team at Stanford illustrated \u2013 and efforts to communicate to the public the difference between the infection fatality ratio ( IFR ) and the case fatality ratio ( CFR ) , have been neglected by Western governments and even more so by the Western corporate media .\nIn some cases , efforts appear to be being made to deliberately obfuscate or confuse this crucial information in order to continue stoking panic and hysteria .\nBut in addition to this , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West \u2013 have been caught using dubious or disorganized methods to tally COVID-19 deaths \u2013 meaning that both IFR and CFR numbers could be easily skewed .\nFor example , British state-funded media outlet , the BBC in an August 2020 article titled , \u201c Coronavirus : England death count review reduces UK toll by 5,000 , \u201d would admit : A review of how deaths from coronavirus are counted in England has reduced the UK death toll by more than 5,000 , to 41,329 , the government has announced .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ new methodology for counting deaths means the total number of people in the UK who have died from Covid-19 comes down from 46,706 to 41,329 \u2013 a reduction of 12 % .\nThe article revealed that Public Health England had \u201c included everyone who had tested positive [ for COVID-19 ] , even if they died months afterwards and their death may have had another cause.\n\u201d Similar statistical gymnastics are being performed in the US .\nEven the New York Times raised the issue fairly early on in article , \u201c Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Why Experts Say No , \u201d clearly inferring that there may be a problem with the official methodology , and went on to explain throughout the article how it is impossible to ever know since accurate counts \u2013 or even accurate systems to use in counting \u2013 may not presently exist in the US .\nIn other words : the current systems are less than perfect and vulnerable to systemic distortions in the presentation of data .\nAgain , this is a fundamental issue when public health policy is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on what were clearly misused and incomplete statistics , the US , the UK , and much of Western Europe have led the world in stoking unprecedented hysteria , enforcing travel restrictions and lockdowns , including the closing of businesses and schools , and grinding the economies of the world to a halt either directly or indirectly \u2013 in a manner similar to but with an impact much greater than the US-led global \u201c War on Terror \u201d starting in 2001 .\nRELATED : UK \u2018 Variant Fears \u2019 Are Over-Hyped Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations \u201d like the World Health Organization ( WHO ) using its UN-affiliated platform to declare a \u201c global pandemic , \u201d along with Western governments and the corporations that dominate foreign and domestic policy , has created a global crisis \u2013 not in terms of human health , but in terms of socioeconomics .\nBusinesses are closed \u2013 not because those who regularly run or patronize them are in hospital beds or dead \u2013 but by order of governments , and with official policy backing from organizations like the WHO .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this \u2013 not only repeating narratives provided by governments and healthcare institutions uncritically , but refusing to fulfill their role as watchdogs and investigators searching out impropriety .\nIt is a state of hysteria that is crippling small and medium-sized businesses ( SME ) , but a boon to big-business .\nHeadlines from papers like the Wall Street Journal admit , \u201c Big Tech Companies Reap Gains as Covid-19 Fuels Shift in Demand , \u201d or as the Guardian reported , \u201c Amazon third-quarter earnings soar as pandemic sales triple profits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are profiting from the hysteria .\nMoreover , the Guardian report , \u201c The mystery of which US businesses are profiting from the coronavirus bailout , \u201d reveals how struggling big-businesses are being bailed out by government money \u2013 while the SME sector , the real pulse of any vibrant economy and society \u2013 is being left behind .\nBut there is one industry who stands out above all others to benefit , an industry notorious for its deeply rooted corruption , and an industry that has already been caught using its ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare pandemics , stoke hysteria , and profit handsomely from the resulting chaos .\nAt no time in human history has it been more powerful and influential than it is now .\nAnd at no other time in human history has it been so dangerous .\nWestern big-pharma \u2019 s profiteering and corruption under ordinary circumstances is already shocking .\nThe current climate of public confusion , panic , and growing socioeconomic desperation only invites the industry \u2019 s impropriety to new levels .\nPharmaceutical corporations like Pfizer , Johnson & Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of dollars directly or indirectly from taxpayers to develop COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 have long , documented histories of corruption , including bribing regulators , doctors , and governments .\nThey have also been caught falsifying safety and efficacy data .\nThey have promoted the use of their products for patients in cases not approved of by regulators , including on children .\nThey have even been caught knowingly selling products they knew were dangerous or even deadly \u2013 withholding critical information from both regulators and the public .\nPfizer alone \u2013 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 was under investigation this year , according to its own Security Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filing , for its Greenstone generics business over antitrust concerns , for manufacturing issues regarding Quillivant XR , regarding quality issues over the manufacturing of auto-injectors , over corruption inquiries regarding its Russian and Chinese operations , and in regards to lawsuits in Mexico over the manufacturing of Zantac and a cancer-causing chemical called N-Nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA ) found in the product .\nThe investigation regarding Zantac finally prompted the US Food and Drug Administration ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug \u2013 to request it be pulled from the market after finding it is indeed linked to an increased likelihood of causing cancer .\nThe Wall Street Journal in a 2020 article titled , \u201c Pfizer Receives Inquiry From SEC Bribery Unit , \u201d would note of Pfizer \u2019 s past scandals that : Pfizer has had past run-ins with U.S. authorities over allegations of bribery among its operations abroad .\nThe company in 2012 agreed to pay $ 60.2 million to settle investigations by the SEC and the Justice Department into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in Europe and Asia , including China and Russia .\nThe US Department of Justice in its own statement regarding part of the 2012 payout by Pfizer would note : According to court documents , Pfizer H.C.P .\nmade a broad range of improper payments to numerous government officials in Bulgaria , Croatia , Kazakhstan and Russia \u2013 including hospital administrators , members of regulatory and purchasing committees and other health care professionals \u2013 and sought to improperly influence government decisions in these countries regarding the approval and registration of Pfizer Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the level of sales of Pfizer Inc. products .\nAccording to court documents , Pfizer H.C.P .\nused numerous mechanisms to improperly influence government officials , including sham consulting contracts , an exclusive distributorship and improper travel and cash payments .\nSuch bribery might help explain why Pfizer and other pharmaceutical corporations are able to sell dangerous products like cancer-causing Zantac or \u2013 in the case of fellow COVID-19 vaccine producer Johnson and Johnson \u2013 cancer-causing baby powder \u2013 for years before mounting lawsuits and public outrage spur regulators to finally do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits alleging that its talc caused cancer , J & J insists on the safety and purity of its iconic product .\nBut internal documents examined by Reuters show that the company \u2019 s powder was sometimes tainted with carcinogenic asbestos and that J & J kept that information from regulators and the public .\nWhat this illustrates is a consistent pattern of corruption stretching across Pfizer \u2019 s ( and Johnson & Johnson \u2019 s ) manufacturing process to their business practices and spanning years .\nIt is an entire industry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly investigated and fined , but allowed to not only continue conducting business \u2013 but is still entrusted with matters critical to public healthcare .\nThe implications it has for the process of developing , approving , producing , and distributing vaccines for COVID-19 should be obvious .\nDespite the immense amount of publicly-known corruption engaged in by the Western pharmaceutical industry and the obviously troubling implications it has for the current COVID-19 vaccine rollout \u2013 it is only one dimension of a much wider problem .\nThere is also the Western pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public scares to attract massive government contracts and wield power and influence over public discourse regarding human healthcare issues .\nThe same large corporate media outlets today helping fuel public hysteria regarding COVID-19 and promoting big-pharma \u2019 s vaccine rollout had previously reported on past instances of big-pharma crying \u201c pandemic , \u201d using its influence over international organizations like the WHO , and securing massive government contracts worth billions of dollars for unnecessary and ineffective medication and vaccines .\nThink back to 2009 and the H1N1 \u201c Swine Flu \u201d scare .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a \u201c global pandemic , \u201d the headlines and articles from the mainstream Western media read almost identical to those being circulated today regarding COVID-19 .\nSeven months into the flu pandemic of 2009 , North America leads the world in cases , the WHO says .\nUnlike elsewhere , the new H1N1 never exited stage left after its debut appearance in late April .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s making more noise than ever .\nMexico has experienced more cases of pandemic flu since September than it did over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring .\nThe ratcheting up of hysteria continued both from the WHO and across the Western media , accompanied by drives to fund vaccine development and stockpile medication like Roche \u2019 s Tamiflu .\nThe UK Daily Mail in a 2009 article titled , \u201c Tamiflu : What you MUST know as swine flu threatens to strike , \u201d would claim : The Government has announced that stocks of drugs \u2013 known as antivirals \u2013 to fight the imminent threat of a swine flu pandemic are being built up to cover more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country \u2019 s population .\nBut as hysteria faded , the truth emerged .\nArticles began to appear like this one from Reuters in 2014 titled , \u201c Stockpiles of Roche Tamiflu drug are waste of money , review finds , \u201d which noted : Researchers who have fought for years to get full data on Roche \u2019 s flu medicine Tamiflu said on Thursday that governments who stockpile it are wasting billions of dollars on a drug whose effectiveness is in doubt .\nThe article also pointed out : Tamiflu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 \u2013 mostly due to its use in the H1N1 flu pandemic \u2013 but they have since declined .\nThere were also Roche \u2019 s financial ties to WHO experts who designated the appearance of H1N1 as a \u201c pandemic , \u201d helping pave the way for the public hysteria required to fuel Roche \u2019 s profits from selling what was essentially a useless drug to government stockpiles .\nThe BBC in their 2010 article , \u201c WHO swine flu experts \u2018 linked \u2019 with drug companies , \u201d would report : Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockpiling of pandemic flu drugs had financial ties with companies which stood to profit , an investigation has found .\nRoche was mentioned by name by the BBC ( emphasis added ) : The advice prompted many countries around the world into buying up large stocks of Tamiflu , made by Roche , and Relenza manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline .\nDespite these revelations post-H1N1 after 2009 , the very same actors have taken the stage for a repeat performance in 2020 \u2013 with little to no alarm from the same media organizations who ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reluctantly reported on it only long after the damage was done .\nOver the past ten years \u2013 big pharma \u2019 s control over the WHO and its influence over both the media and Western governments has only grown .\nPowerful organizations like the Wellcome Trust \u2013 which claims to be an \u201c independent foundation \u201d funded through an investment portfolio \u2013 counts several large pharmaceutical corporations \u2013 Novartis , Roche , Johnson & Johnson , and Abbott Labs \u2013 on their list of \u201c significant directly held public equity holdings.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , various Western governments , academia , the media , and of course the WHO itself .\nIt is an institutionalization of the conflicting interests that have tolerated , accommodated , even helped expand the unwarranted power , wealth , influence , and corruption of big pharma .\nAnd while Wellcome Trust claims to be \u201c independent \u201d of corporate and government ties , alongside the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 it has helped create another front organization called The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) \u2013 through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western taxpayers \u2019 money .\nThe work of CEPI directly impacts the business prospects of many of the corporations Wellcome Trust owns stocks in \u2013 with its investments paying off above average amid this most recent round of public hysteria and government spending on this latest declared pandemic .\nInternational Publishers Limited in an article titled , \u201c Wellcome Trust \u2018 prospers \u2019 under COVID-19 fallout with 12.3 % return , \u201d would report : Wellcome Trust \u2019 s portfolio has not just survived , but prospered , in the highly volatile environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliza Manningham-Buller , the charity \u2019 s chair , introducing its annual report which unveiled a 12.3 % return for the year to 30 September 2020 , up on the 6.9 % of the previous year .\nThe trust , which supports medical research worldwide , is the UK \u2019 s largest charity , with a \u00a329.1bn ( \u20ac31.9bn ) portfolio at end-September 2020 .\nWellcome \u2019 s investments have returned an average 12.1 % a year over the past decade .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that back in March , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation provided $ 125 million in \u201c seed funding \u201d to accelerate certain pharmaceutical products claiming to treat COVID-19 , including Gilead Science \u2019 s antiviral Remdesivir .\nDespite failing repeatedly in clinical trials , and after the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) was exposed attempting to rewrite the rules in their attempt to salvage the drug \u2019 s reputation as a viable therapeutic for COVID-19 \u2013 Remdedivir was continually hyped in the media by Bill Gates and NIH Director Der Anthony Fauci , and is still defended by the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also important to note that as of 2020 , the number one funder of the World Health Organization is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , who supplied the WHO with approximately $ 531 million in its 2018-19 biennial budget , roughly 12 % of WHO \u2019 s total budget .\nUnlike the H1N1 scare and multiple scandals that emerged out from behind the smokescreen of public hysteria deliberately created around it , the COVID-19 crisis has been sustained for now nearly a year with enduring regiments being put in place to condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the flow of information through traditional channels as well as online and particularly across US-based social media platforms , and direct public funding into the coffers of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry .\nAt the same time , other major industries are either being spared the same regulations and restrictions strangling smaller businesses out of existence , or being bailed out by public funding .\nIt has gone from the \u201c H1N1 Heist \u201d of 2009 to what appears to be a \u201c Pandemic Industrial Complex \u201d taking shape today .\nHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accurately \u2013 disfiguring society , is up to those people who can clearly see public and private sectors conspiring together and consisting of the least reliable partners for actually taking on a real pandemic and protecting the public from it \u2013 if that is truly what we are facing .\nOn one hand , even if we believe the statistics and claims being made on a daily basis by the mainstream media and government representatives , we can see for ourselves the corporations elected by the government to create the solutions claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are guilty of serial abuses including the production and distribution of entirely unsafe products \u2013 products developed and \u201c approved \u201d of by government regulators under normal conditions that would go on to making people ill or even killing them .\nBut the COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out now aren \u2019 t even going through that process .\nThey have instead been rushed through approval and unpredictable results and adverse effects are already emerging .\nIt harkens back to another chapter involving a novel virus \u2013 1976 \u2019 s Swine Flu \u2013 where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mounting adverse effects , particularly paralyzing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in over 400 individuals .\nAnd these were only the cases that were reported , as the true total of those who suffered varying degrees of complications will never be fully known .\nIn 1976 , the vaccination program was abandoned and the government \u2019 s response deemed a failure of historic proportions .\nBut apparently the lessons learned then , or in 2009 , have been lost entirely today \u2013 and in some cases \u2013 deliberately buried by a complicit media .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is \u2013 why isn \u2019 t there a greater demand for more trustworthy and transparent partners to work with to face it ?\nThese would be partners capable of acknowledging past mistakes and explaining how their plan today differs from those in the past .\nBut unfortunately , history has already taught us that pandemics can be declared \u2013 not because they actually exist and/or pose as grave a threat as government , media and corporate stakeholders claim \u2013 but because profits are to be made by big pharma , in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have the unique power to declare pandemics , and perpetuate them regardless of the truth .\nWe watched for two decades as the West orchestrated an entirely false \u201c War on Terror \u201d around the globe , justifying actions as extreme as invasions , wars , and illegal occupations of other countries and the expenditure of trillions of dollars of taxpayers \u2019 money .\nIs it really that hard to imagine as possible , this formula being reworked atop the 2009 H1N1 scandals and pushed forward aggressively ?\n*** Author Brian Berletic @ @ @

true nature of the threat posed to public health .\nIs the government \u2019 s \u2018 cure \u2019 worse than the disease ?\nAre government estimates completely overblown ?\nThanks to a number of wildly exaggerated \u2018 official \u2019 doomsday predictions like those made by my favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conflicting theoretical guesses as to the UK \u2019 s \u2018 death rate \u2019 have thrown the exercise into disarray , leaving many members of the public confused as to the actual nature of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus and COVID 19 , along with many also asking whether

crisis .\nIndeed , some psychologists believe that mass hysteria can be a form of groupthink .\nIn some cases , group members can rapidly develop a common fear which more often than not \u2013 spirals

plans for \u201c re-opening \u201d the country , which include COVID-19 tracking via cell phones and mass vaccination program As the world , and the United States , waits anxiously for news of when the outbreak and lockdown will end , two new plans outline requirements that will significantly impact our already suspended civil liberties .\nAn important article published in STAT titled , \u201c Two new road maps lay out possible paths to end coronavirus lockdowns , \u201d reveals two plans for re-opening our country , one which offers no definite timeline , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Ezerkiel Emanuel is vice provost of global initiatives and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania .\nEmanuel \u2019 s opinion on how to \u2018 stop the virus \u2019 is : \u201c A nationwide shelter-in-place or quarantine should take place for the next eight to 10 weeks .\nAccording to Chinese data , this would mean the number of Covid-19 cases would peak in four weeks or so and then decline over the next four to six weeks .\nSo , as hard as it would be , everybody but essential workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1st.\n\u201d Included in his suggestions are the following remedies , predicated as they are on surveillance of the entire population and an egregious violation of privacy : \u2022 \u201c State and local health department then need to deploy thousands of teams to trace contacts of all new Covid-19 cases using cellphone data , social media data , and data from thermometer tests and the like .\nWe also need to get infected people to inform their own contacts .\nIt would be easier to lift the national quarantine if we isolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their contacts , and isolate any of them who may be infected.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Create a Covid-19 certification system .\nStates should use blood tests to certify people who have had Covid-19 , are immune and are no longer contagious .\nThese people could then work in hospitals or other areas where being risk-free would be a benefit.\n\u201d Emanuel \u2019 s mention of a \u201c Covid-19 certification system \u201d is reminiscent of the \u201c digital certificate \u201d s Bill Gates recently suggested would be required to ensure that everyone has either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or received a vaccine against it .\nGates also recently suggested that digital certificates of this kind would be required to travel in the future .\nEmanuel estimated that if these , and additional steps are taken the earliest the national lockdown could lift is by June .\nThe timeline suggested by Emmanuel agrees with statements Trump delivered yesterday ( 3/30/20 ) , wherein he said that he believed cases of COVID-19 would peak by Easter , and that a recovery would begin in June .\nGotleib \u2019 s Plan With Plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , 20-page plan was devised by Scott Gotleib who is a former commissioner of the FDA , and actively sits on the board of Pfizer ; Gotleib , along with several co-authors , including Caitlin Rivers , an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , envisions four phases for re-opening the country .\nPhase 1 : the current situation , in which the outbreak is growing .\nPhase 2 : this phase begins when certain conditions are met \u2014 such as hospitals being able to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new cases have dropped for at least 14 days .\nThe report suggests that if containment erodes in specific counties or states , they would fall back to Phase 1 status .\nPhase 3 : the lifting of all restrictions would only occur when a vaccine and therapeutics are available , which Gottlieb estimates would take two years away for the vaccine , and sooner for medications ( by summer ) .\nPhase 4 : would involve building the country \u2019 s capacity to respond to the next biological threat .\nGottleib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly invasive surveillance of the population via the GPS functionality of cell phones : \u201c Massively Scale Contact

draconian police state ( Image Source : ABC 14 News ) Guy Birchall RT International With most of Europe imposing extraordinary restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus , Sweden has left its citizens surprisingly free .\nAre Swedes rolling the dice with their public health , or is everyone else overreacting ?\nAs most of Europe clamps down in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19 , one country is bucking the trend .\nSweden is taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus .\nDespite its closest neighbours , Denmark and Norway , shutting down all but essential services , Swedes remain free to socialise as the harsh Scandinavian winter comes to an end .\nAlthough universities and high schools have shut , pre-schools , kindergartens , bars , restaurants , ski resorts , sports clubs and hairdressers have all remained open .\nThe streets of Stockholm and Malmo are noticeably quieter than usual , but positively bustling compared to those of Copenhagen , Oslo , London , Paris and Rome .\nStanding in bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a seat they \u2019 re free to enjoy a night out .\nOther steps taken include gatherings of more than 50 people being banned and the over 70s being urged to self-isolate .\nWith the exception of Belarus , which hasn \u2019 t even suspended its football league , Sweden \u2019 s restrictions amount to the most relaxed out there .\nThis has prompted observers both in and outside the country to wonder if they are playing fast and loose with the nation \u2019 s health or taking the most proportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stefan Lofven has warned that times ahead would be tough but also put the onus on individual Swedes .\nHe added : \u201c We all , as individuals , have to take responsibility .\nWe can \u2019 t legislate and ban everything.\n\u201d This tactic is at odds with the strategy in the UK which has been to tell citizens to stay at home and limit leaving the house to once a day .\nSweden \u2019 s experts have taken a very different view to the UK \u2019 s , with their state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial College London modelling , predicting 250,000 deaths and informing Boris Johnson \u2019 s strategy , is \u201c pessimistic \u201d .\nThe latest numbers in Sweden show nearly 3,500 cases and 105 deaths .\nTengell told The Observer : \u201c As long as the Swedish epidemic development stays at this level , I don \u2019 t see any big reason to take measures that you can only keep up for a very limited amount of time.\n\u201d Sweden \u2019 s move has allowed for businesses to stay open , reducing the impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach has been broadly well received by the public , who view it as a more sensible course of action than the draconian steps taken in other countries .\nIt also places the country in a better position to ramp back up to full capacity after the pandemic subsides .\nLofven \u2019 s government seems less inclined to be seen to just \u201c do something \u201d compared to many in the West .\nSwedes have not clamoured for the state to restrict their freedoms in the same way many in other countries appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what the best response to this year \u2019 s outbreak turns out to be , but for the moment Sweden \u2019 s more laissez-faire approach should be heartening to its population .\nThe government entrusting its citizens to observe advice and adjust their behaviours accordingly without the threat of police intervention is something that should be applauded in a free society .\nIt also maintains a higher level of trust going in the other direction , from the public to the government .\nOn a practical level , not employing draconian measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public and allows for a slower escalation of measures should they be needed .\nTrust is an important factor in a democracy where a government rules by consent of the people .\nPublic trust in Sweden is exceptionally high , with citizens having faith that their politicians are acting in the public interest .\nTheir propensity to treat adults like adults is key to that trust remaining .\nWithout question , sacrifices will have to be made in the fight against Covid-19 , but it is vital that public trust in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost .\nBy taking a more measured response and basing their actions of advice rather than enforcement , Sweden \u2019 s government is taking a gamble but arguably a less risky one than Britain or Germany have .\nSweden is allowing its economy to function at a much more normal level than the rest of Europe , which has effectively almost shut down .\nIf the pandemic turns out not to be as fatal as , for example , Britain \u2019 s experts initially feared , then the draconian measures enforced by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than the disease .\nHowever , if it does turn out to be as deadly as predicted , but no more so in Sweden than in other countries , the government could still not be accused of having done nothing but would still be in a more economically stable condition .\nThe only situation that would leave the Swedish government truly open to criticism would be if the mortality rate in Sweden outstrips similar countries , but thus far

This is the all-too familiar clarion call to action which circulates between the mainstream media , the public , and government , and normally in that order .\nOf course , history is replete with examples of gross overreaction in policy by monarchs , dictators and democracies .\nIt doesn \u2019 t take much for the government \u2019 s prescribed course of action to quickly undermine the intended goal .\nIn the case of the coronavirus outbreak , we \u2019 re told that the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 but have Western governments really thought through the full social and economic ramifications of implementing draconian \u2018 lockdown \u2019 measures in order to quarantine their populations ?\nEarly on , UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ( who recent said he had tested positive to COVID-19 ) spoke about the need to \u201c strike a balance \u201d when implementing state measures to contain the contagion , but he quickly backed off this rhetoric after being savaged by a hysterical mainstream corporate media who were railing in fear that not enough was being done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then made to shutdown the country \u2019 s real economy and society , and divert most public resources to \u201c fighting the invisible enemy.\n\u201d .\nBusinesses , schools , gyms , cafes , institutions , parks were all closed by government decree , with subjects now ordered to stay indoors for an indefinite period of time , until the government deems it to be safe to reinstate the public freedoms and rights .\nIn the end , it was alarmism that won the day , and dictated official government efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real question which should have governed government policy was never really asked : exactly how severe of a threat to public health is the coronavirus ?\nEven today , mainstream media and government \u2018 experts \u2019 are drifting out competing doomsday scenarios , each pretending to be able to project the number of dead.\n\u201d The whole affair has descended into some bizarre dystopian daily weather report , with endless dashboards , decorated in ever more complex-looking mortality computer models and graphs .\nSomewhere along the line , the government and its faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream media \u2013 forgot about the very real dangers of over-reacting to what might turn out to be a marginal threat compared to other seasonal outbreaks and pathogens .\nThe UK has overrated to the coronavirus outbreak and the current lockdown measures put in place to contain the virus could be less dramatic , according to a former NHS consultant pathologist .\nThere have been 2,352 deaths in the UK due to Covid-19 , while the total number of confirmed cases is 29,474 .\nStrict lockdown rules have been put in place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earlier this week , professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London claimed that the rate of hospital admissions suggests social distancing guidelines have made an impact .\nBut Dr John Lee , a retired professor of pathology , suggests that there has been a worldwide overreaction to coronavirus and a lack of testing means that governments have been unable to get an accurate understanding of the severity of the disease .\nDr Lee also believes that current evidence suggests coronavirus isn \u2019 t much worse than seasonal flu .\n\u2018 The key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it \u2019 s very difficult to interpret any numbers without context for those numbers , \u2019 Dr Lee told Sky News .\n\u2018 So the numbers we \u2019 ve been hearing of deaths do indeed sound very alarming and we \u2019 ve all been seeing very alarming pictures from around the world .\nBut the question is we can \u2019 t understand those numbers without knowing how they relate to other numbers related to deaths and disease.\n\u2019 \u2018 My point is the way we compare diseases is by comparing death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die of a disease compared to the number of people who got the disease .\nAnd in this case we really have no idea at the moment how many people have actually had the disease because we haven \u2019 t been testing widely enough to actually understand those numbers.\n\u2019 \u2018 We don \u2019 t know those certain yet but certainly there \u2019 s a growing body of informed opinion that feels the severity of this disease has been overestimated .\nWhenever you look at the severity of the disease early in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see the tip of the iceberg.\n\u2019 \u2018 What you don \u2019 t see is all the people with no symptoms or very mild symptoms .\nSo there is evidence that this disease isn \u2019 t necessarily much worse than a seasonal flu.\n\u2019 \u2018 But what we are seeing is a synchronisation of cases , so health services are being put under great pressure , but that doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that when we look back on this disease in six months or a year \u2019 s time it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional or very exceptional .\n\u2018 I think it \u2019 s very sensible to prepare , I mean obviously health services are under great pressure and we should prepare for being able to being able to deal with as many cases as we possibly can do .\n\u2018 What I \u2019 m saying is that actions have been taken only looking at one thing .\nThe advice from the Government has been based only on the Covid figures , we haven \u2019 t had any assessment whatsoever of the harms being caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken .\nOf course , countries around the world tend to copy each other .\nThe question is what \u2019 s proportionate action ?\nAnd proportionate action is quite possibly less than what \u2019 s being taken at the moment.\n\u2019 \u2018 In dealing with the Covid cases we \u2019 ve been taking resources away from other cases that are in the health services , and the impact of that really isn \u2019 t known at the moment .\n\u2018 When the Prime Minister quite rightly said nine days ago he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would agree with that , it \u2019 s a very sensible thing to do .\nBut following the science is different from following one group of scientists.\n\u2019 \u2018 What you have to try to understand is that science is a discussion .\nAnd the Imperial model is based on a lot of assumptions , and on incomplete data , and it \u2019 s only one interpretation of the measurements we currently have.\n\u2019 \u2018 What I \u2019 m saying is we need to continue to critically evaluate the all data that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data , and as I said a great body of informed opinions \u2019 assessment of the data , is that we are , on a global basis , overreacting to the disease.\n\u2019 \u2018 This is the first pandemic of the media age .\nAnd that has had a big effect on how people perceive the disease .\n\u2018 The numbers do seem very alarming but I think if only the Government spokespeople and the mainstream media could present a more nuanced version of the numbers it would reduce people \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the numbers do indicate that we could probably contain this disease with a less dramatic form of social isolation that we \u2019 ve gone into at the moment .\n\u2019", "author": "21wire", "url":
