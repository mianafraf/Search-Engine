(Part 2)", "date": "2020-05-22", "source": "americandigitalnews", "title": "PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN OUT TRUMPED (Part 2)", "content": "By James Hovda \u2013 My 2 Cents of Sense : PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN OUT TRUMPED ( Part 2 ) Since the Civil War , there has been a campaign set to reverse what our Fore Fathers designed .\nAmericans had shown that they were barbaric , inhumane , self-centered , and unforgiving .\nIt was obvious that groups could no longer work together , and this effected the political movement to isolate the government away from the people .\nThe people had to be controlled .\nBut the quest became , \u201c How do you control a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the US constitution ?\n\u201d That answer came in 1871 when Congress cut a deal with the international bankers ( specifically Rothschilds of London ) to incur a debt to said banks they owned .\nWith a stroke of a pen , and by skirting around the legal process of making law , the Act of 1871 made the \u201c UNITED STATES \u201d into a corporation , thus giving America two very distinct constitutions\u2026 one pertaining to the people , the other to pertain to government .\nWith no constitutional authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of government for the District of Columbia , ( see , \u201c Acts of the Forty-first Congress \u201d Section 34 , Session III , chapters 61 and 62 ) .\nThe CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is the constitution of the incorporated UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , capitalized , with the word \u201c OF \u201d changed from the original word \u201c For \u201d .\nWhat Congress did by passing the Act of 1871 was create an entirely new document , a constitution for the government of the District of Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altered Constitution was not intended to benefit the Republic .\nIt benefits only the corporation of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and operates entirely outside the original ( organic ) Constitution .\nInstead of having absolute and unalienable rights guaranteed under the organic Constitution , we , the people , now have \u201c relative \u201d rights or privileges granted by government .\nThe proof can now be seen by how the government is responding to the COVID virus by removing our freedoms , rights , and liberties in the name of \u201c safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Trump last February .\nThen again , the American people were sold out by their very own Congress in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created .\nThe Federal Reserve Note was then created , a simple piece of paper which lost all worth in 1933 when the US was taken off the gold standard .\nThe Federal Income Tax Act made every person a debtor to pay back the loans from the globalists \u2019 banks , and we have been paying for it ever since .\nAs previously stated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War .\nAmerica had basically collapsed , and became unsustainable .\nThe changes came in small spurts ever since Woodrow Wilson , but were highly effective in transforming our Republic of , by , and for the people to a plutocracy government .\nEvery president since Lincoln has used Executive Orders to create \u201c rule of law \u201d that has removed the freedom , rights , and liberty from the general public , and to place it into the hands of the wealthy , corporations , and socialist organizations who rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too many Executive Orders to list , as many are still in full effect .\nEO \u2019 s give the POTUS the power needed to executively bypass the other two branches of government , and only a president can remove or change it .\nAn example is Executive Order 12803 , signed by George HW Bush , which gave Washington D.C. the authority to sell America \u2019 s infrastructure .\nEvery president from Bush , Clinton , GW , and Obama approved and signed the Executive Order for \u2018 Sustainable Development \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New World Order under their watch .\nTrump is the only one who has not complied with moving Agenda-21 further .\nThere is actually a website ( OneWorldGov.org ) that needs to be researched and shared by every American who wants to protect freedom .\nThere are also links at the United Nation \u2019 s website to Agenda-21 , Agenda 2030 , and Vision 2050 that lays out the step-by-step procedures for America \u2019 s conquest and world globalization .\nAt least these people are no longer hiding their intentions .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Hillary usher in the next era of America , and thus the next era in globalization .\nShe failed because the people of America woke up .\nAn outsider was instead placed into position to cause severe damage to their NWO agenda , and reverse course of America \u2019 s direction .\nOne by one , President Trump began to remove all those EO \u2019 s that had become detrimental for America , as he began his MAGA initiative to return the glory of the nation , and place its fate back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , the majority welcomed such a reversal\u2026 a revival of the American Dream through the American Way .\nTrump grabbed the old guard by the balls and squeezed hard\u2026 so hard that they organized in order to devise a way to fight back , and return things back along their pathway , and off trail from Trump \u2019 s MAGA agenda .\nThe point of all those bombshells against Trump wasn \u2019 t really to remove him from office , as they all knew that would be impossible without holding the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey needed to weaken Trump , and keep him distracted and away from doing further damage to their NWO agenda .\nTheir plan was in distraction , isolation , and to keep his administration and the people off guard in order to launch their new weapon of a global pandemic\u2026 one they knew would cause massive destruction without damaging the landscape .\nThose of you who think this virus was a fluke of nature and coincidental , then you need to wake up to smell the coffee and study \u201c coincidences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none , and there are none in China , either .\nThe pieces of the puzzle are out there , and all one needs to do is to place them accordingly to reveal the big picture .\nThis virus was purposely placed in order to give Trump an offer he could not refuse .\nEither have millions die on his watch , or cripple the economy into collapse .\nTrump tried to save both form happening , but the Powers That Be held all the trump cards in this game .\nWho gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go Stalinistic upon their own citizenry , their own businesses , and their own economic existence ?\nWho is advising the President \u2019 s Council on how to fight this pandemic that came from nowhere at the perfect time when Trump just won his impeachment trial , and was set to take action against the past wrongdoers , while getting ready to sweep another election that would close the doors on the NWO for a very long period ?\nWho has remained a thorn in the side of Trump from day one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out ?\nStill don \u2019 t think there is a conspiracy ?\nThere is no doubt that America and the entire world has been effected and changed .\nThe transformations are taking shape , as our freedom , liberty , and independence are quickly being altered and removed .\nTrump has his back against the globalists \u2019 wall , and he has to move away from it very cautiously .\nThe arrows have been aimed directly at him , as any false move will trigger a gauntlet of effective strikes he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs we deepen into this year , millions continue to lose their job , thousands of businesses go under , bankruptcies , divorce , suicide , crime , addiction , and attacks upon the family are skyrocketing , as the nation treads on unstable ground to see if we were correct that this was all a ruse , or if the virus can come back to plunge us further down the abyss of desolation .\nNow there is a new virus that is \u201c COVID related \u201d which is attacking our young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there may not be any school , no day care , no family theme parks , no summer camps , no public pools or playgrounds\u2026 we are at the mercy of \u201c experts \u201d who none of us trust any longer because of all the lies we \u2019 ve been told thus far .\nIt is very important to follow each one \u2019 s career , who they are related to , and what organization they are affiliated to .\nThat will tell us whom we can and can not trust .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in simply six weeks .\nAs the virus rips our headlines daily , fear grips this nation to make the people panic and complacent .\nAmericans do adapt easily , as we seek contingencies in trying to keep the momentum going forward .\nBut as everything is now focused upon the virus that remains , shutting down everything , we are forgetting this is an election year that will certainly become the direction we go from here on end .\nPaper ballots , Internet voting , no voting booths ?\nWill elections now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will no longer count , but to make it look good as if everything is perfectly normal ?\nTrump says \u201c No !\n\u201d The Left says \u201c Yes !\n\u201d He knows the American version of the Stalin quote that paralyzed Russia into 75 years of totalitarian communism\u2026 \u201c It matters not who votes\u2026 It matters who counts the votes.\n\u201d As the numbers of infected and the numbers of deaths do not stop , there will be more and more restrictions placed upon us to comply to measures never taken before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor many , the fear has changed to frustration and outrage , as the COVID-19 virus doesn \u2019 t seem any different than influenza or any other communicable disease .\nMaybe our sheltering in place , wearing protective gear , washing our hands until they bleed , and spraying sanitizers on everything has made an impact\u2026 maybe it has all been for naught ?\nMore states are trying to recover because their economies are in severe duress .\nBut the restrictions , although not as stringent , still remain , as masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain public places remain closed , and life is not returning to normalcy fast enough .\nI doubt it ever will , as this has set the stage for our future , a brave new world to separate us further , to contain us even more , and to make this new Order even more tyrannical and oppressive .\nWill we always have to wear masks and gloves , face plexiglass sneeze shields , have our temperature taken to enter a store , remain in our spaces until we can be waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and home delivery to be the new norm for shopping ?\nWill schools re-open ?\nWill elective surgeries be re-established , and our doctors re-open their doors to receive patients who don \u2019 t only have the virus ?\nWill we get arrested for wanting to return to normalcy , and face prosecution for only trying to live our life as we once did ?\nWill sports , concerts , and events have an empty stadium , and will movies have to be paid for through Netflix and other venues than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar relief packages where most of the money will never go to those intended to relieve ?\nTake a wild guess who is actually getting much from this funding ?\nLook up their expenditures\u2026 you will never find where all that money actually went !\nShould states begin to see an increase of deaths and infections , you can guarantee what freedoms and civil liberties you think you have will be all tossed out the window .\nAmerica is now in a state of emergency , and FEMACORP runs the entire show .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforce compliance .\nBy law , it will be at least another six months before they can begin to loosen their grip over us , and governments can begin returning to normal\u2026 if that ever happens .\nThose who buck the system are called every name in the book .\nThey are told they are the reason for such restrictions , as they refuse to stay sheltered at home .\nYet , across America , your chain stores , such as Walmart , Lowes , Target , and Costco , remain business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their supplies without being extremely cautious .\nBut the mom & pop stores who only see a fraction of those numbers enter are being told they must remain closed , or limit the numbers by 2/3rds who enter their establishment , plus follow all CDC and federal/state guidelines in order to remain open .\nFor many businesses , it comes down to either complying , or break the law in order to survive .\nFor those many , none of it makes any sense .\nShould we be looking to make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top don \u2019 t want you to question their decisions \u2026 they only want you to comply .\nI talk to dozens of people daily , as most will agree with most of what I \u2019 ve been saying , but professionals and those with a name will only be lap dogs for the mainstream to repeat what they say instead .\nMany are too scared to tarnish their reputation and name to fight for liberty , and rectify injustices .\nThey remove themselves from the game by stating , \u201c I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be , because politics now effects each one of us , and everyone \u2019 s future !\nFor those who have braved the waters and fought off the sharks , all power to you .\nYou are truly our nation \u2019 s heroes .\nYou face permanent closure , arrest , and heavy fines to speak your mind to say \u201c enough is enough !\n\u201d Even the keyboard warriors who type day in and night out are making their mark .\nVideos are posted , and then removed , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they play by their rules , not by ours .\nWhen things get rough , the liberals will all circle the wagons to protect their own , while continuing to hammer the Right and the truth we try to release .\nActually , this all does make perfect sense when you fit the right pieces of the puzzle into place .\nI have spent a big portion of my life research the NWO and those on top of the totem pole .\nTheir actions are predictable , just as their motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life get there because they will play by their rules .\nThose who make waves will only see their retaliatory response .\nThat is how power and control is assumed .\nLook at Islamic nations , as fear keeps many in line and afraid to speak out .\nThey know what is coming should they betray their people and the religious doctrine that Prophet Mohamed , a barbaric pedophile , set into stone .\nThe Nazis had the SS , as Stalin had the KGB and the Red Army to enforce compliance\u2026 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , then silence those who speak against it .\nBy establishing fear among the citizenry , it becomes the first link in a chain to bring about a totalitarianism empire .\nIt works every time .\nI have been suspicious of this virus and the developing plague since this broke out .\nI know these people well , have read their books , and understand their thinking .\nI saw this coming , but had hope that we would be smarter than this , since to come to these extremes with America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far we will go , and how complacent we will become .\nThis may just be a small experiment of theirs , as we have allowed ourselves to be persuaded into relinquishing more freedoms and liberty for the sake of safety .\n911 didn \u2019 t teach us a thing , and if it did , we simply forgot , as we got lost in our own revival of seeing America put back together under

ve been warning about the new global order that has been laid out upon us .\nWe can call it \u201c the New World Order \u201d as our past presidents have called it , or we can call it whatever we like , but the result is the same , regardless .\nOur freedom and liberty is being turned over to entities who will become our handlers from birth to grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform a specific duty to gather resources for those in power , while given a rope that is neither slack nor tight to hang ourselves with .\nOur true destiny is now creeping upon the horizon , as the clouds of a destructive storm can be seen to finish what was started many years ago .\nIt is known that most \u201c conspiracies \u201d are proven to be factual long after most had phoo-phooed the notion .\nProof is never easy to provide , as most suspicions are thought to be an abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does take a good detective to put the pieces of the puzzle together to form the correct bigger picture , but not impossible to do .\nMany do get it wrong , most don \u2019 t actually care one way or another just so long as their personal life and lives of their family are not too disturbed .\nBut those who do get it right are hounded into the seas to be shown to the public that they are incorrect , accusations made up , and claims are meaningless .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy if not silenced , as campaigns are organized to make the theorists out to be some sort of mental ignoramus .\nDo you truly believe that the Civil War was declared in order to just free the slaves ?\nDo you truly believe The Federal Reserve was created to make our dollar stronger and more stable ?\nDo you truly believe that the Federal Income Tax was created to simply bring revenue to the Feds to operate our government more efficiently ?\nDo you truly believe that President Roosevelt and his Joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor ?\nDo you truly believe that Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had no other choice but to let the Soviet Russians take over the whole eastern block of Europe ?\nDo you truly believe that the United Nations was established to bring peace and prosperity throughout the world ?\nDo you truly believe that the assassinations of JFK , RFK , and MLK were committed entirely by just one lone gunman ?\nDo you truly believe that the Korean and Vietnam Wars were started to simply help a small country of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nDo you truly believe Richard M Nixon was a dictator-president who ruled with an iron fist against America \u2019 s best interests ?\nDo you truly believe Ronald Reagan had no choice but to make George H.W .\nBush his VP ?\nDo you believe Hinkley \u2019 s story of why he tried to assassinate President Reagan ?\nDo you truly think that the War on Drugs was really planned to be winnable ?\nDo you truly believe that 911 was committed by Islamic radical extremists who were ordered by Osama bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon , and White House ?\nDo you truly believe that the election of Barack Obama was never orchestrated by greater powers ?\nDo you truly believe that a few FBI agents were the only ones involved and connected to Fast & Furious ?\nDo you truly believe that

you truly believe that the COVID-19 coronavirus was a fluke of nature that got out of control to become a global pandemic to where the people were forced to go into quarantine isolation in order to stop the spread of the virus ?\nHistory is a funny thing .\nThere are more than just one truth when it comes to what actually happened .\nThere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed to the public eye , and recorded in the books for later referral .\nHistory can also be changed , removed , or simply denied it ever happened .\nIt all depends upon the intent of recognizing the event .\nThose who do analyze past events find pretty compelling evidence that disputes what \u201c historians \u201d record .\nOnce found , does their new evidence change history , or do we simple go on as if the lies are actually the truth ?\nTime and time again , we hear the stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small events like a car accident , everyone saw something differently , and as time goes past , the whole event becomes so distorted to where people believe the opposite of what actually occurred .\nHistory is no different .\nEven with actual video and recorded evidence to support a claim , those who are involved still try to tell the event differently , and convince others they had no involvement\u2026 they stand firm upon their original statements .\nA very long time ago , I accidentally walked in on a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true American patriots who were trying to defend America from the great powers who wanted to destroy America , convert the nation into a global unifier , and thus create the New World Order .\nThey let me remain , as I was very skeptical after listening to them for several hours .\nI was like most to believe it all to be a \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d , that was until they dumped a stack of books , papers , and recordings into my lap to \u201c review the evidence \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in life to stop it , but they were trying to teach others of the coming armageddon that would move America into a \u201c new era \u201d about 50 years in the future .\nAfter concluding my research , I found that their accusations were quite valid , and believed like they did\u2026 that America was in a dire assault to fundamentally transform it for an event that would change the course of the country to de-populate the citizenry , converge the states into a federation , transform the US and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government , and put the United Nations in charge of all forms of governance to become the global unifier for the New World Order .\nI have studied Donald J Trump since the mid 1980 \u2019 s .\nI found from reading and listening to everything there is to learn about him that he is the \u201c Einstein of economics \u201d in modern times .\nTrump may be as American as George Washington , and has always believed that the global elitist were the defacto creators of the world \u2019 s anxieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , war , famine , plagues , and fascist ideals to corral the citizenry to remove those who were useless to them , and enslave the rest for a \u201c 1984 \u201d style world under their domain and full control .\nI have watched since that night of that meeting as the predictions have become true in many respects .\nI have learned that we really don \u2019 t elect the right people for the job of government , nor stop those we feel are removing our freedoms , liberty , and independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that all men are created equal , that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness.\n\u201d We are no longer the masters of our own destiny , as our lives have become the property of the highest bidder .\nWe are nothing but chess pawns on their game board to be moved to the position they chose , and to be removed when we get in the way .\nI don \u2019 t know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global elitist are really descendants from gods , or aliens , or whatever\u2026 but they have been in power and in charge since ancient times .\nThey have accumulated enough wealth to control anything they desire , and pretty well already do , as the branches of every business is connect to their main trunk , and they are the roots below .\nIn every government , the same people seem to dominate through many election cycles .\nAlthough they may lose their position , they are shifted into other areas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another .\nWe can never seem to get a wholesale shift spread wide enough to have an impact upon our destiny , nor remove them all .\nWe seem to rely upon those \u201c experts \u201d who might be knowledgeable in their field to some degree , but their motivation is purely political and global in nature .\nThey have never and will never work for we , the people .\nThey are groomed and employed by those we never see , nor ever hear of .\nThese NWO disciples are recruited early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not refuse .\nMany come from a long line of families who have been faithful servants to the Order , and given a lifestyle like no other in return for their loyalty .\nThe Trump family has no ties with the globalists .\nThey have made their own wealth from their own mind and hands .\nMaybe one reason why that family has been so despised for so long ?\nIn something I read a while back , Donald Trump said ( paraphrased ) , \u201c My father was always approached from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would scratch their back , they would return the favor 10-fold .\nNo amount of money or favors could keep my father from doing what he felt was right .\nHe said he didn \u2019 t need those kind of people in his life , and neither do I .\nMy father never did sell his soul to the Devil , and neither will I.\n\u201d Most Americans are not politically savvy .\nMost Americans look after themselves and their family , and could care less who is in control and what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t effected nor harmed .\nMost vote because of ads , because of looks , because of family heritage , because they speak articulately , because of political affiliation\u2026 every reason except the right reason .\nAre they the best qualified candidate , and will they honor their pledges ?\nDoes America come first ?\nWe already know that answer , as few actually do as they say , but expect us to do as they say .\nPolitics has taken on its own life since the days of Washington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have never worked a day in their life at a normal job like us .\nThe longer they are in office , the more power they get , and the more powerful they feel that they must control matters by their own reasoning\u2026 not through logic , common sense , or rational conclusion .\nPower is a drug that is very addictive , and some abuse it as cocaine addicts , as both eventually destroys the mind and their ability to the thought process that makes the best choices .\nThese governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the addiction to power will do , because most have forgotten their Oath of Office , and their responsibility to those whom they serve .\nThe Powers That Be have always felt that America stood in their way of a new world order .\nOf course it does , as our Founders and Framers purposely designed America to protect itself from their grip and their wrath .\nThat was up until the Civil War .\nLincoln may be the father of the Republican Party , he may have been conservative , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war between the North and South had begun long before the shots were fired , Lincoln tried to take the South \u2019 s sovereignty away .\nThe South wasn \u2019 t fair in negotiating , as was Lincoln , but both felt like they were getting screwed in many areas beside that of slavery .\nSlavery became a tool over their disagreements , as much of it had really to do over money , taxes , political power , and commerce .\nAs I said earlier , history is written by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can mostly be learned when you spend some time in the South to learn it from the true historians , not from those who write school book text .\n( End Part 1 )", "author": "Ami Tiel", "url":

see that much abuse from law officers unless they are truly in a violent , mental outrage that \u2019 s uncontrollable .\nBut from what we saw in this incident , that was never the case .\nOnce the cuffs were on , the fight was over with Mr Floyd , but the MPD felt there was more subduing that needed to be performed for reasons still not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the throat for over 5 minutes is inexcusable , and most certainly beyond the MPD guidelines of arrest .\nWhen Mr Floyd repeatedly said , \u201c I can \u2019 t breath !\n\u201d that should have been the time to remove the knee bondage from his throat .\nBut what is done is done , and another person has died at the hand of over zealous police hormones .\nMr Floyd didn \u2019 t brandish any weapon , nor did he put up much resistance while being apprehended .\nHe may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the legal sense , but to treat anyone as a meth-zombie out to eat the officers alive is beyond SOP by the FOP when their own life , or of someone else , wasn \u2019 t in grave danger .\nWe \u2019 ve been here before under Obama , and where did that get us ?\nMore hate for the police ; more racial division ; more excuses for BLM and ANTIFA groups to rally in anarchist fashion ; more looting , burning , and rioting NOT IN THE NAME of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , it was if it was all planned out\u2026 can that be said again here in this incident ?\nWhen approached by various media , many rioters were from other states\u2026 some saying they were bused and paid to be there as radical \u201c representatives of true justice \u201d .\nGeorge Soros must be writing some pretty awesome checks to have that many anarchists in that many cities across America\u2026 there must be a deeper cause ?\nCould this all be due to Trump , the coming election , and more reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near fatal pandemic attack on its economy ?\nThe Left , no matter what categorized division they represent , wants to seek America \u2019 s total demise , the fundamental transformation into socialism-communism-globalism , and the removal of Trump and Republican supporters by any and all means .\nThey are in a state of war , as conservatives and their representatives do not feel it has gone that far .\nBut it is time for them to wake up .\nWar doesn \u2019 t always have to have tanks , artillery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a violent enemy who seeks change , and a total demise for their enemy\u2026 and that is with us who still believe in Americanism , patriotism , the Constitution , God , mom , and apple pie .\nSo , what do you expect from people who have just undergone a 2 1/2 month furlough from life ?\nThese people haven \u2019 t worked , many have permanently lost their job .\nMany have been forced out of school , as they have been held inside their home like a prisoner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost loved ones , while normalcy was robbed and replaced with tyranny and oppression from their mayor , governor , and the CDC .\nAmerica is in a state of suppression , and to do something like that in Minneapolis , or anywhere , was a match to light a fuse to an explosion .\nAnd that is what you are seeing tonight on your television !\nDon \u2019 t plan for this to end anytime soon , even if the officers were fired , and the one who put his knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd degree murder/manslaughter .\nThis has now gone beyond that incident .\nThis is not about \u201c justice \u201d any longer\u2026 this is about \u201c revenge \u201d with a relief valve being opened after having the guts ripped out of the nation and its economy by something that wasn \u2019 t justified by government in doing\u2026 to lock down a nation after spreading a fear & panic campaign to get everyone to unwillingly surrender their freedom and liberty , again , in the name of \u201c safety \u201d .\nThe smell of \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time .\nAmerica wasn \u2019 t designed to undergo this type of radical transformation , as most people were very happy and quite content before the CCP unleashed a Holy-Hell plague .\nAnd who took the brunt of this year \u2019 s CCP pandemic disruption ?\nThe blacks , Latinos , the poor , and minimum wage earners .\nMany of them had one or both parents die from the coronavirus since its mortally infected the elderly and those with chronic diseases and infections .\nIt has been the Blue States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran by progressives , that have had the largest hits in infections , deaths , and economic hardships .\nAnd , these regions of the nation have the largest populous of minorities , poverty , and sick , disabled and poor older people .\nMost involved in these \u201c protests \u201d are under the age of 30 .\nThey are the lost zombies caught between Obama indoctrination and socialist reformation .\nThey are opportunists looking for something to place their mark upon , and this may be the chance of their lifetime .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ true justice , as there are still incidents of police abuse and brutality being conducted nation wide .\nTo be arrested for simply going outside in your front yard , letting your child play on a swing set , cut someone \u2019 s hair , selling ice cream , having a picnic in a park , or go surfing on a deserted beach is not American , even under circumstances such as a harmful virus .\nWe have those every few years , and never had to endure such Soviet-state actions before .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ books as the biggest ruse ever pulled over the eyes of America .\nTo say this \u201c plague \u201d wasn \u2019 t a conspiracy , one would have to be completely deaf , dumb , and blind .\nThis is just the beginning .\nWe will see things get further out of hand , more violent reactions , more police intervention , more state actions from government , more deaths , and more reason for the NWO to pull the plug on our freedom and liberty .\nGranted , the people who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw flaming cocktails at police , and induce mob rioting have stepped too far over their \u201c civil liberties \u201d , as they do deserve to be arrested , tear-gassed , and treated as thugs\u2026 but we have to take a step back to ask why this is happening , who really is to blame , and what can we do to fix this ?\nIt is just only action being taken against reaction .\nThrowing gasoline on a fire will not help , and the best solution is to fix the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside .\nThe problem is with those whom these inner city people keep re-electing .\nThe problem is with progressive and liberal Democrats who seek power and control over the people .\nThe problem is with these elected idiots denying there is a problem , then sugar coat any disruption with emotions of pity , empathy , and forgiveness instead of stopping anarchy in its tracks .\nYou can stand on the streets with a sign until you grow old by the millions , but when the first rock is thrown , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first fire is lit , then the party is over .\nIf this isn \u2019 t quelled now , we will be hearing of gun battles in the near future\u2026 you can bet on that !\nDemocrats do not want an election this year , or to have one in the normal sense of the past .\nThey know their ass is on the hook , and that they are about to get skinned and gutted .\nAmericans are sick and tired of all this crap , and are quickly figuring out who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many Republicans are in the shadows doing their own thing to hurt the economy , Trump , and a Republican sweep , because they stand to lose a ton of money , too , if it does .\nBut America isn \u2019 t about the politicians nor their sugar daddies\u2026 it is about the people , their small business , their income , and their freedom and liberty set by God and the Founders .\nAnd once we elect those who understand this , the more we will advert such actions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all go about our life in some manner of normalcy .\nDon \u2019 t you think ?\nThank you for your support !", "author":

marvel of modern mega-engineering : The Three Gorges Dam .\nIt might be about to collapse .\nWhat happens if it does ?\n1/ Completed over twenty-one years ( 1994-2015 ) out of more than 28 million cubic meters of concrete and 463,000 tons of steel , the 185 meter tall Three Gorges Dam is today the largest hydroelectric dam on earth .\nIt generates around 2 % of China \u2019 s total electrical power demand .\n2/ As far back as 1918 , Chinese political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the ever-present threat of catastrophic flooding up and down the Yangtze River .\nIn 1931 , more than 300K people were killed by floods .\nIn 1954 and 1998 , 3K+ perished in each year .\n3/ In 1982 , Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping promised to make the Three Gorges Dam a reality .\nBy 1992 , enough political support had been assembled for the project to be approved .\nThe groundbreaking was in Dec 1994 , though it wasn \u2019 t until 1997 that the first concrete was poured .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of pride for the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) .\nMega-engineering projects are a signal to the world that a nation has stepped into an elite tier of economic powerhouses .\nFor the CCP , it is further proof that authoritarianism is more effective than capitalism .\n5/ However , the project did not come without enormous costs .\nThe price tag has run more than $ 30 billion US Dollars .\nChoking off the sedimentary flow of the river reduces the available fertile silt required by farmland downstream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All things considered , the Three Gorges Dam truly is a herculean feat of engineering , political willpower , and propaganda .\nThis despite the risks and challenges for the people of China \u2013 especially the more than 55 million people who live along the Yangtze downstream .\n7/ It \u2019 s beyond my ken to assess the structural risks and likelihood of failure for the TGD .\nCCP officials are downplaying risk , because that \u2019 s what they do .\nNow to the point of this thread \u2013 extrapolating the geopolitical/supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dam .\n8/ We must first understand the importance of the Yangtze River in practical terms .\nThe watershed of the Yangtze is broadly divided into the Upper , Middle , and Lower Reaches .\nEach reach is an industrial powerhouse , with specific economic and military significance .\n9/ The westernmost Upper Reach is anchored by Chongqing , a massive megacity-region of more than 30 million people .\nAs China \u2019 s west-facing Beltand Road gateway , Chongqing plays a critical role in connecting the Yangtze to Central Asia and Europe via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d 10/ The rail service \u2013 called \u201c Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe Railway \u201d \u2013 stretches more than 11,000 km and traverses a number of Central Asian nations .\nIt is operated jointly by Chinese , Russian , and German logistics companies , and just departed its 10,000 train in March .\n11/ However , the CXE does not just serve Chongqing and Chengdu .\nIt connects cargo to China \u2019 s massive central/eastern industrial base via the Yangtze River \u2019 s container-on-ship service .\nThis subsidized , shorter routing cuts transit time to Wuhan from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-way multi-modal service was a safety valve for the central China industrial region ( centered in Wuhan ) when ocean and air cargo service ground to a halt at the onset of COVID-19 .\nTrucks traveled to Chongqing , with cargo moving to Europe on the CXE .\n13/ While Chongqing is the westernmost cargo hub on the Yangtze , it is closely connected via the river to the Port of Shanghai some 1,400 km away .\nAt Chongqing , all ocean-bound exports to/from western China are consolidated , numbering more than 1,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations have become critical trade partners with Chongqing/W.China , as traffic along the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor has exploded .\nThis China-Singapore joint venture has seen almost 2,000 container trains move since 2017 .\n15/ It is clear that the CCP views connecting China \u2019 s western provinces to the world through Chongqing as a major strategic initiative .\nAnd while rail is the primary mode to achieve this , it is the freight carrying capacity of the Yangtze that makes the project possible .\n16/ Eastward from Chongqing , we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , home to the Three Gorges Dam .\n313km downriver from the dam sits Wuhan at the border of the Lower Reach .\nIt \u2019 s the most important interior city in China and a critical military , manufacturing , and tech hub .\n17/ In this article for @ theammind , I explored the importance of Wuhan to China and global trade .\nIt is the central node of the Yangtze River \u2019 s logistics network .\nA failure of the ports here means zero ocean container traffic upriver from the delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chains Caught A Cold .\n18/ The Port of Wuhan handles more than 1.5 mil containers/year , 50 % more than Chongqing .\nWuhan \u2019 s Tianhe airport serviced more than 24 million passenger in 2018 , and a little more than 220K MT of air cargo ( equivalent to about 2,000 747 \u2019 s ) .\nIt \u2019 s also the PPE hub of China .\n19/ So , let \u2019 s divert for a moment to what happens downriver if the Three Gorges Dam fails .\nA 100m-tall wall of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km/hr .\nIn 30 minutes , Yichang and its 4 million residents will be engulfed .\n( Map Credit : u/BerryBlue_BlueBerry @ Reddit ) 20/ Zero+1 hour , Jingzhou and 5.7 million people will be swept away .\nZero+5 , the major industrial city of Yueyang ( 5.5 mil people ) will sit 5m underwater .\nZero+10 hours , Wuhan ( 11 mil people ) will face flooding of 6-8m in all major industrial and port zones .\n21/ Zero+15 hours , Jiujiang ( another major PPE hub with 4.7 mil residents ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding .\nAll cropland and infrastructure will be flooded and damaged .\nZero+24 hours , Shanghai \u2019 s neighboring city of Nanjing will see its port crippled .\n22/ Note , the Yangtze watershed is massive , but Biblical levels of rain have been flooding western and central China for weeks .\nThere simply is nowhere for the water to go , except outwards towards the East China Sea , and the world \u2019 s largest port of Shanghai .\n23/ Circling back now to Wuhan and the impacts to supply chains\u2026 Ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million TEU ( standard unit of container measure , \u201c twenty foot equivalent unit \u201d ) in cargo traffic in 2019 .\nBy comparison , Shanghai handled 42 million TEU in 2019 .\n24/ In simple terms , the Yangtze River logistics and manufacturing complex comprises 46 % of the volume of the largest port on earth , since all cargo flows through Shanghai .\nFailure of the Three Gorges Dam would annihilate the entire logistics infrastructure of central China .\n25/ The Yangtze River east of the dam bases many PLA anti-air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force assets .\nSeveral entities ( Taiwan included ) have speculated openly about the ability to strike the dam with missiles and cause massive downstream devastation .\n26/ Such an unlikely attack on the dam would no doubt trigger immediate reprisal by the CCP and PLA .\nBut what happens if the dam naturally fails due to excessive water and engineering flaws ?\nHow does China respond , and how do foreign companies recover manufacturing capacity ?\n27/ From an economic/military standpoint , all activity on the Yangtze would halt .\nThe rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking months to complete , and only after the waters recede .\nPeak water levels may not crest until August\u2026and Yangtze ports are already slowed .\n28/ The Yangtze River Economic Basin has a GDP of more than $ 6.5 trillion , or about half of all China \u2019 s GDP .\nRecall , China represents 28 % of all manufacturing output \u2013 globally .\nMore than half of that is in the YREB .\n15 % of the world \u2019 s production would go offline in 24 hours .\n29/ A wipeout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the already-congested Port of Shanghai , slowing vessel rotations to other Chinese and Asian ports by days or weeks .\nFood imports \u2013 a critical item for China \u2013 would be slowed as refrigerated containers are bottlenecked .\n30/ A slowdown at Shanghai would place additional pressure on the northern ports of Tianjin and Qingdao , and central/southern ports like Ningbo , Xiamen , and Yantian .\nMore manufacturers will offshore from China to SE Asia , creating more chokepoints .\n31/ China \u2019 s central banking system , already cracking under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will not be able to help domestic companies recover fast enough .\nThe CCP will not be able to keep subsidizing production in attempt to keep the economy growing .\n32/ The middle reach of the Yangtze River is also China \u2019 s main agriculture production zone , where the crops are enaring harvest .\nAfrican Swine Fever rages on .\nFamine will follow without huge imports of protein from the US , Europe , and S. America .\nHmm .\nChina makes its largest ever purchase of U.S. corn Far behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the United States , China bought 1.76 million tonnes of U.S. corn , its largest purchase ever .\nof American corn .\nhttps : //www.agriculture.com/news/business/china-makes-its-largest-ever-purchase-of-us-corn 33/ China \u2019 s central and northern region water supply \u2013 especially in Beijing \u2013 is dependent on the Yangtze .\nAdditionally , given that 2 % of China \u2019 s electricity is produced by the dam , recovery of the industrial base in the YREB would be crippled due to energy shortfalls .\n34/ The lingering health effects associated with so many dead or sick from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services in the region , which are still trying to recover as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic .\nAnd\u2026it gets worse .\n35/ It \u2019 s the habit of authoritarian regimes to deflect from domestic disasters by lashing outward to external enemies or entities .\nIt is thus a certainty that a failure of the dam will be painted as enemy action \u2013 likely pointing the finger at the US and/or Taiwan ( recall # 26 ) .\n36/ Within days , the CCP/PLA will start saber-rattling .\nHarassment of US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate-range ballistic missiles , rhetoric aimed at Taiwan , etc .\nThis will spill over into major disruptions of the East and South China Seas .\n37/ Commercial ship lines ( such as Maersk , MSC , CMA-CGM ) and their import customers in North America will see increased transit times as non-China transshipment ports take on additional volume and vessels redirect around the contested waters .\nAs with COVID-19 , the system will buckle .\n38/ Many companies in Europe and North America still recovering from the supply chain shock earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-CCP sentiment further .\nAll of these factors combined will nearly guarantee open conflict between the US and China .\n39/ So what does a failure of the Three Gorges Dam look like ?\nIt would be among the most horrific humanitarian crises in memory , triggering a cascade effect of famine , war , and economic depression that will threaten global peace .\n40/ For just one example
